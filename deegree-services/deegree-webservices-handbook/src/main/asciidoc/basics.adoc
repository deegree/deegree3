== Configuration basics

In the previous chapter, you learned how to access and log in to the
deegree service console and how to download and activate example
workspaces. This chapter introduces the basic concepts of deegree
webservices configuration:

* The deegree workspace and the active workspace directory
* Workspace files and resources
* Workspace directories and resource types
* Resource identifiers and dependencies
* Usage of the service console for workspace configuration

The final section of this chapter describes recommended practices for
creating your own workspace. The remaining chapters of the documentation
describe the individual workspace resource formats in detail.

=== The deegree workspace

The deegree workspace is the modular, resource-oriented and extensible
configuration concept used by deegree webservices. The following diagram
shows the different types of resources that it contains:

.Configuration aspects of deegree workspaces
image::workspace-overview.png[]

The following table provides a short description of the different types
of workspace resources:

[width="100%",cols="31%,69%",options="header",]
|===
|Resource type |Description
|Web Services |Web services (WFS, WMS, WMTS, CSW, WPS)

|Data Stores (Coverage) |Coverage (raster) data access (GeoTIFFs, raster
pyramids, etc.)

|Data Stores (Feature) |Feature (vector) data access (Shapefiles,
PostGIS, Oracle Spatial, etc.)

|Data Stores (Metadata) |Metadata record access (ISO records stored in
PostGIS, Oracle, etc.)

|Data Stores (Tile) |Pre-rendered map tiles (GeoTIFF, image hierarchies
in the file system, etc.)

|Map Layers (Layer) |Map layers based on data stores and styles

|Map Layers (Style) |Styling rules for features and coverages

|Map Layers (Theme) |Layer trees based on individual layers

|Processes |Geospatial processes for the WPS

|Server connections (JDBC) |Connections to SQL databases

|Server connections (remote OWS) |Connections to remote OGC web services
|===

Physically, every configured resource corresponds to an XML
configuration file in the active workspace directory.

=== Dependencies of the deegree configuration files

The following diagram shows the different types of resources and their
dependencies. The deegree configuration can be divided into several
sections:


* web services
* data stores
* map layers
* server connections


For example, to offer a Web Feature Service, a feature store (based on a
shapefile, database, etc) must be configured. With a rasterfile, like a
GeoTIFF, you can configured a tile store and a coverage store to offer a
Web Map Service.

.Workspace configuration dependencies
image::workspace-configuration-dependencies.png[Workspace configuration dependencies]

=== Location of the deegree workspace directory

The active deegree workspace is part of the _.deegree_ directory which
stores a few global configuration files along with the workspace. The
location of this directory depends on your operating system.

==== Linux/Solaris/Mac OS X

On UNIX-like systems (Linux/Solaris/MacOS X), deegree's configuration
files are located in folder _<$HOME/.deegree/_. Note that _$HOME_ is
determined by the user that started the web application container that
runs deegree. If you started the ZIP version of deegree as user
"kelvin", then the directory will be something like
_/home/kelvin/.deegree_.

TIP: In order to use a different folder for deegree's configuration files,
you can set the system environment variable _DEEGREE_WORKSPACE_ROOT_.
Note that the user running the web application container must have
read/write access to this directory.

==== Windows

On Windows, deegree's configuration files are located in folder
_%USERPROFILE%/.deegree/_. Note that _%USERPROFILE%_ is determined
by the user that started the web application container that runs
deegree. If you started the ZIP version of deegree as user "kelvin",
then the directory will be something like _C:\Users\kelvin\.deegree_
or _C:\Dokumente und Einstellungen\kelvin\.deegree_.

TIP: In order to use a different folder for deegree's configuration files,
you can set the system environment variable _DEEGREE_WORKSPACE_ROOT_.
Note that the user running the web application container must have
read/write access to this directory.

==== Global configuration files and the active workspace

If you downloaded all four example workspaces (as described in <<anchor-lightly>>), set a console password and the proxy parameters,
your _.deegree_ directory will look like this:

.Example _.deegree_ directory
image::workspace-root.png[Example _.deegree_ directory]

As you see, this _.deegree_ directory contains four subdirectories.
Every subdirectory corresponds to a deegree workspace. Besides the
configuration files inside the workspace, three global configuration
files exist:

[width="94%",cols="37%,63%",options="header",]
|===
|File name |Function
|<subdirectory> |Workspace directory
|console.pw |Password for services console
|proxy.xml |Proxy settings
|webapps.properties |Selects the active workspace
|===

Note that only a single workspace can be active at a time. The
information on the active one is stored in file _webapps.properties_.

TIP: Usually, you don't need to care about the three files that are located
at the top level of this directory. The service console creates and
modifies them as required (e.g. when switching to a different
workspace). In order to create a deegree webservices setup, you will
need to create or edit resource configuration files in the active
workspace directory. The remaining documentation will always refer to
files in the (active) workspace directory.

TIP: When multiple deegree webservices instances run on a single machine,
every instance can use a different workspace. The file
_webapps.properties_ stores the active workspace for every deegree
webapp separately.

=== Structure of the deegree workspace directory

The workspace directory is a container for resource files with a
well-defined directory structure. When deegree starts up, the active
workspace directory is determined and the following subdirectories are
scanned for XML resource configuration files:

[width="81%",cols="43%,57%",options="header",]
|===
|Directory |Resource type
|services/ |Web services
|datasources/coverage/ |Coverage Stores
|datasources/feature/ |Feature Stores
|datasources/metadata/ |Metadata Stores
|datasources/tile/ |Tile Stores
|layers/ |Map Layers (Layer)
|styles/ |Map Layers (Style)
|themes/ |Map Layers (Theme)
|processes/ |Processes
|jdbc/ |Server Connections (JDBC)
|datasources/remoteows/ |Server Connections (Remote OWS)
|storedqueries/managed/ |Stored queries created via WFS interface
|===

A workspace directory may contain additional directories to provide
additional files along with the resource configurations. The major
difference is that these directories are not scanned for resource files.
Some common ones are:

[width="94%",cols="36%,64%",options="header",]
|===
|Directory |Used for
|appschemas/ |GML application schemas
|data/ |Datasets (GML, GeoTIFF, ...)
|manager/ |Example requests (for the generic client)
|===

==== Workspace files and resources

In order to clarify the relation between workspace files and resources,
let's have a look at an example:

.Example workspace directory
image::workspace-example.png[Example workspace directory]

As noted, deegree scans the well-known resource directories for XML
files (_*.xml_) on startup (note that it will omit directory
_manager_, as it is not a well-known resource directory). For every
file found, deegree will check the type of configuration format (by
determining the name of the XML root element). If it is a recognized
format, deegree will try to create and initialize a corresponding
resource. For the example, this results in the following setup:

* A metadata store with id _iso19115_
* A JDBC connection pool with id _conn1_
* A web service with id _csw_

The individual XML resource formats and their options are described in
the later chapters of the documentation.

TIP: You may wonder why the _main.xml_ and _metadata.xml_ files are not
considered as web service resource files. These two filenames are
reserved and treated specifically. See <<anchor-configuration-service>>
for details.

TIP: The configuration format has to match the workspace subdirectory, e.g.
metadata store configuration files are only considered when they are
located in _datasources/metadata_.

==== Resource identifiers and dependencies

It has already been hinted that resources have an identifier, e.g. for
file _jdbc/conn1.xml_ a JDBC connection pool with identifier _conn1_
is created. You probably have guessed that the identifier is derived
from the file name (file name minus suffix), but you may wonder what
purpose the identifier serves. The identifier is used for wiring
resources. For example, an ISO metadata store resource requires a JDBC
pool, because it provides the actual connections to the SQL database.
Therefore, the corresponding resource configuration format has an
element to specify it:

*Example for wiring workspace resources*

[source,xml]
----
<ISOMetadataStore configVersion="3.4.0" xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/datasource/metadata/iso19115">

  <!-- [1] Identifier of JDBC connection -->
  <JDBCConnId>conn1</JDBCConnId>

  [...]

</ISOMetadataStore>
----

In this example, the ISO metadata store is wired to JDBC connection pool
_conn1_. Many deegree resource configuration files contain such
references to dependent resources. Some resources perform auto-wiring.
For example, every CSW instance needs to connect to a metadata store for
accessing stored metadata records. If the CSW configuration omits the
reference to the metadata store, it is assumed that there's exactly one
metadata store defined in the workspace and deegree will automatically
connect the CSW to this store.

TIP: The required dependencies are specific to every type of resource and are
documented for each resource configuration format.

=== Using the service console for managing resources

As an alternative to dealing with the workspace resource configuration
files directly on the filesystem, you can also use the service console
for this task. The service console has a corresponding menu entry for
every type of workspace resource. All resource menu entries are grouped
in the lower menu on the left:

.Workspace resource menu entries
image::console_resources.png[Workspace resource menu entries,scaledwidth=50.0%]

Although the console offers additional functionality for some resource
types, the basic management of resources is always identical.

==== Displaying configured resources

In order to display the configured workspace resources of a certain
type, click on the corresponding menu entry. The following screenshot
shows the metadata store resources in deegree-workspace-csw:

.Displaying metadata store resources
image::console_metadata_stores.png[Displaying metadata store resources,scaledwidth=50.0%]

The right part of the window displays a table with all configured
metadata store resources. In this case, the workspace contains a single
resource with identifier "iso19115" which is in status "On".

==== Deactivating a resource

The "Deactivate" link allows to turn off a resource temporarily (while
keeping the configuration):

.Deactivate action
image::console_deactivate.png[Deactivate action,scaledwidth=50.0%]

After clicking on "Deactivate", the status of the resource will be
"Off", and the "Deactivate" link will change to "Activate". Also, the
"Reload" link at the top will turn red to notify that there may be
changes that need to be propagated to dependent resources:

.Deactivated a resource
image::console_deactivated.png[Deactivated a resource,scaledwidth=50.0%]

TIP: When a resource is being deactivated, the suffix of the corresponding
configuration file is changed to ".ignore". Reactivating changes the
suffix back to ".xml".

==== Editing a resource

By clicking on the "Edit" link, you can edit the corresponding XML
configuration inside your browser:

.Edit action
image::console_edit.png[Edit action,scaledwidth=50.0%]

The XML configuration will be displayed:

.Editing a resource configuration
image::console_editing.png[Editing a resource configuration,scaledwidth=50.0%]

You can now perform configuration changes in the text area and click on
"Save". Or click any of the links:

* Display Schema: Displays the XML schema file for the resource
configuration format.
* Cancel: Discards any changes.
* Turn on highlighting: Perform syntax highlighting.

If there are no (syntactical) errors in the configuration, the "Save"
link will take you back to the corresponding resource view. Before
actually saving the file, the service console will perform an XML
validation of the file and display any syntactical errors:

.Displaying a syntax error
image::console_edit_error.png[Displaying a syntax error,scaledwidth=50.0%]

In this case, the mandatory "JDBCConnId" element was removed, which
violates the configuration schema. This needs to be corrected, before
"Save" will actually save the file to the workspace directory.

==== Deleting a resource

The "Delete" link will deactivate the resource and delete the
corresponding configuration file from the workspace:

.Delete action
image::console_delete.png[Delete action,scaledwidth=50.0%]

==== Creating a new resource

In order to add a new resource, enter a new identifier in the text
field, select a resource sub-type from the drop-down and click on
"Create new":

.Adding a WMS resource with identifier "mywms"
image::console_add.png[Adding a WMS resource with identifier "mywms",scaledwidth=50.0%]

The next steps depend on the type of resource, but generally you have to
choose between different options and the result will be a new resource
configuration file in the workspace.

[[anchor-console-errors]]
==== Displaying error messages

One of the most helpful features of the console is that it can help to
detect and fix errors in a workspace setup. For example, if you delete
(or deactivate) JDBC connection "conn1" in deegree-workspace-csw and
click "[Reload]", you will see the following:

.Errors in resource categories
image::console_error.png[Errors in resource categories,scaledwidth=50.0%]

The red exclamation marks near "services" and "metadata" show that these
resource categories have resources with errors. Let's click on the
metadata link to see what's going on:

.Resource "iso19115" has an error
image::console_error2.png[Resource "iso19115" has an error,scaledwidth=50.0%]

The metadata resource view reveals that the metadata store "iso19115"
has an error. Clicking on "Show errors" leads to:

.Details on the problem with "iso19115"
image::console_error3.png[Details on the problem with "iso19115",scaledwidth=50.0%]

The error message gives an important hint: "No JDBC connection pool with
id 'conn1' defined." deegree was unable to initialize the metadata
store, because it refers to a JDBC connection pool "conn1". You may
wonder what the error in the services category is about:

.Details on the problem with "csw"
image::console_error4.png[Details on the problem with "csw",scaledwidth=50.0%]

As you see, the problem with the service resource ("There is no
MetadataStore configured, ensure that exactly one store is available!)
is actually a consequence of the other issue. Because deegree couldn't
initialize the metadata store, it was also unable to start up the CSW
correctly. If you add a new JDBC connection "conn1" and click on
"[Reload]", both problems should disappear.

==== Resource type specific actions

In addition to the common management functionality, some resource views
offer additional actions. This is described in the corresponding
chapters, but here's a short overview:

* Web Services: Display service capabilities ("Capabilities"), edit
service metadata ("Edit metadata"), edit controller configuration ("Edit
global config")
* Feature Stores: Display feature types and number of stored features
("Info"), Import GML feature collections ("Loader"), Mapping wizard
("Create new" SQL feature store)
* Metadata Stores: Import metadata sets ("Loader"), create database
tables ("Setup tables")
* Server Connections (JDBC): Test database connection ("Test")

=== Best practices for creating workspaces

This section provides some hints for creating a deegree workspace.

==== Start from example or from scratch

For creating your own workspace, you have two options. Option 1 is to
use an existing workspace as a template and adapt it to your needs.
Option 2 is to start from scratch, using an empty workspace. Adapting an
existing workspace makes a lot of sense if your use-case is close to the
scenario of the workspace. For example, if you want to set up INSPIRE
View and Download Services, it is a good option to use
<<anchor-workspace-inspire>> as a starting point.

In order to create a new workspace, simply create a new directory in the
_.deegree_ directory.

.Creating the new workspace _myscenario_
image::workspace-new.png[Creating the new workspace _myscenario_]

Afterwards, switch to the new workspace using the services console, as
described in <<anchor-downloading-workspaces>>.

==== Find out which resources you need

The first step is to identify the types of workspace resources that you
need for your use-case. You probably know already which types of
services your setup requires. The next step is to identify the
dependencies for every service by having a look at the respective
chapter in the documentation. Let's say you want a setup with a
transactional WFS, a WMS and a CSW:

* A WFS instance requires 1..n feature stores
* A WMS instance requires 1..n themes
* A CSW instance requires a single metadata store

Now you have to dig deeper: What kinds of feature stores exist? Maybe
you will find out that what you want is an SQL feature store. So you
read the respective part of the documentation and see that an SQL
feature store requires a JDBC connection pool resource. Do the same
research for the WMS dependencies. A WMS depends on a theme. Find out
what a theme is and what it requires. In short, you have to answer the
following questions for every encountered resource:

* What does resource do?
* How is it configured?
* On which resources does this resource depend?

At the end of this process you should know about the resources that you
will have to configure for your setup.

TIP: Alternatively, you can approach the resources question bottom-up. Let's
say you have your data ready in a PostGIS database. You want to
visualize it using a WMS. So you would require a JDBC resource pool that
connects to your database. You need a simple SQL feature store (or an
SQL feature store) that uses the new connection pool. You create one or
more feature layers that are wired to the feature store and a theme
based on the layers. At the end of the chain is the WMS resource which
has to be configured to use the theme resource. Rendering styles can be
created later (references have to be added to the layers configuration).

==== Use a validating XML editor

All deegree XML configuration files have a corresponding XML schema,
which allows to detect syntactical errors easily. The editor built into
the services console performs validation when you save a configuration
file. If the contents is not valid according to the schema, the file
will not be saved, but an error message will be displayed:

.The services console displays an XML syntax error
image::console_edit_error.png[The services console displays an XML syntax error,scaledwidth=50.0%]

If you prefer to use a different editor for editing deegree's
configuration files, it is highly recommended to choose a validating XML
editor. Successfully tested editors are Eclipse and Altova XML Spy, but
any schema-aware editor should work.

TIP: In case you are able to understand XML schema, you can also use the
schema file to find out about the available config options. deegree's
schema files are hosted at http://schemas.deegree.org.

==== Check the resource status and error messages

As pointed out in <<anchor-console-errors>>, the service console
indicates errors if resources cannot be initialized. Here's an example:

.Error message
image::console_error3.png[Error message,scaledwidth=50.0%]

In this case, it was not possible to initialize the JDBC connection (and
the resources that depend on it). You can spot resource categories and
resources that have errors easily, as they have a red exclamation mark.
Click on the respective resource level and on "Errors" near the broken
resource to see the error message. After fixing the error, click on
"Reload" to re-initialize the workspace. If your fix was successful, the
exclamation mark will be gone.

Additional information can be found in the deegree log. If you're
running the ZIP version, switch to the terminal window. When
initializing workspace resources, information on every resource will be
logged, along with error messages.

.Log messages in the deegree log
image::terminal.png[Log messages in the deegree log,scaledwidth=50.0%]

TIP: If you deployed the WAR file, the location of the deegree log depends
on your web application container. For Tomcat, you will find it in file
_catalina.out_ in the _logs/_ directory.

TIP: More logging can be activated by adjusting file _log4j2.properties_ in
the _/WEB-INF/classes/_ directory of the deegree web application. See chapter <<anchor-logging-configuration>> for more information how to configure the logging framework.
