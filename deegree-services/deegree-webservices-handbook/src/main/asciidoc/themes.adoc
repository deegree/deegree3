== Map themes

A theme defines a tree like hierarchy, which at each node can contain a
number of layers. For people familiar with WMS, a theme is basically a
layer tree without the actual layer definition.

In deegree it is used to define a structure with layers to be used in
service configurations, notably WMS and WMTS. The concept originated
from the WMTS 1.0.0 specification, with a strong hunch that it might be
used in subsequent WMS specifications as well (namely WMS 2.0.0).

To configure a theme, you should already have a couple of layers
configured. Right now there are two types of theme configurations
available. The most commonly used is the 'standard' theme configuration,
where you manually configure the structure. Another is a configuration
which extracts a theme from a remote WMS resource's layer tree.

A theme always has exactly one root node (theme). A theme can contain
zero or more sub-themes, and zero or more layers.

=== Standard themes

The standard theme configuration is used to manually configure themes.
One configuration can contain one or more themes. A theme configuration
makes use of the common _description_ and _spatial_ elements
described in the layer chapter. If the metadata is not specified, it
will be copied from layers within the same node.

In order to reference layers, the theme configuration needs to know
layer stores. That's why the first thing you need to specify are the
layer stores you intend to use:

[source,xml]
----
<Themes xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/themes/standard"
                              xmlns:d="http://www.deegree.org/metadata/description"
                              xmlns:s="http://www.deegree.org/metadata/spatial">

  <LayerStoreId>layerstore</LayerStoreId>
  <LayerStoreId>layerstore2</LayerStoreId>
  <Theme>
  ...
  </Theme>
  ...
</Themes>
----

Let's have a look at the actual theme configuration. First, you have the
choice to give the theme an identifier or not. Then you can specify the
description and spatial metadata (only the _Title_ element is
mandatory here). If it does not have an identifier, it will not be
requestable in the service configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<Theme>
  <Identifier>roads</Identifier>
  <!-- common description elements here -->
  <!-- common spatial metadata elements here -->
  ...
</Theme>
----

After that, you can add layers and subthemes as required to the theme:

[source,xml]
----
<Theme>
  ...
  <Layer>roads</Layer>
  <Layer layerStore='layerstore2'>highways</Layer>
  <Theme>
    ...
    <Theme>
      ...
    </Theme>
  </Theme>
</Theme>
----

As you can see, you can optionally specify which layer store a given
layer comes from. This can be useful if you have multiple layer stores
offering a layer with the same name.

Since the names of the layers are not used when using WMS, this
mechanism can be used to combine multiple layers (configuration wise)
into one (WMS wise, in deegree terms it would be one theme with multiple
layers).

The following table summarizes the configuration of a theme:

[width="100%",cols="23%,13%,18%,46%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|Identifier |0..1 |String |The unique identifier of the layer

|_Description_ |0..1 |Several |The link:#description[description]
elements described above, *Title* is mandatory

|_Spatial metadata_ |0..1 |Several |The link:#spatial[spatial] metadata
elements described above

|LegendGraphic |0..1 |String |Reference to a LegendGraphic

|Layer |0..n |String |Identifier of the Layer

|Theme |0..1 |Several | Subthemes of the theme
|===

The optional LegendGraphic element can be used to configure a legend graphic for a theme grouping multiple layer or subthemes. The LegendGraphic can be a local file or remote reference. A remote reference is not recommended for production instances of deegree due to possible availability dropouts and security reasons.
The attribute _outputGetLegendGraphicUrl_ (default value is _true_) defines if the _OnlineResource_ of _LegendURL_ contains a _GetLegendGraphic_ request (_outputGetLegendGraphicUrl="true"_) or references the remote resource directly (_outputGetLegendGraphicUrl="false"_).

=== Remote WMS themes

The remote WMS theme configuration can be used to extract a theme from a
remote WMS resource's layer tree. This is most commonly used when trying
to cascade a whole WMS.

The configuration is very simple, you only need to specify the remote
WMS resource you want to use, and the layer store from which layers
should be extracted:

[source,xml]
----
<RemoteWMSThemes xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/themes/remotewms">
  <RemoteWMSId>d3</RemoteWMSId>
  <LayerStoreId>d3</LayerStoreId>
</RemoteWMSThemes>
----

deegree will automatically add layers to the theme, if a corresponding
layer exists in the layer store. In case the layer store is also
configured based on the remote WMS used here, there will be a
corresponding layer for each requestable layer from the remote WMS.

Using this kind of configuration, you can duplicate a complete WMS using
15 lines of configuration (3 for the remote WMS, 3 for the remote WMS
layer store, 4 for the theme and 5 for the WMS).
