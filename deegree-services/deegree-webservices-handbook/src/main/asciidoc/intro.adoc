== Introduction

deegree webservices are implementations of the geospatial webservice
specifications of the http://www.opengeospatial.org[Open Geospatial
Consortium (OGC)] and the http://inspire.jrc.ec.europa.eu[INSPIRE
Network Services]. deegree webservices 3.2 includes the following
services:

* http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs[Web Feature Service
(WFS)]: Provides access to raw geospatial data objects
* http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms[Web Map Service (WMS)]:
Serves maps rendered from geospatial data
* http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts[Web Map Tile Service
(WMTS)]: Serves pre-rendered map tiles
* http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat[Catalogue Service for the
Web (CSW)]: Performs searches for geospatial datasets and services
* http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wps[Web Processing Service
(WPS)]: Executes geospatial processes

With a single deegree webservices installation, you can set up one of
the above services, all of them or even multiple services of the same
type. The remainder of this chapter introduces some notable features of
the different service implementations and provides learning trails for
learning the configuration of each service.

=== Characteristics of deegree WFS

deegree WFS is an implementation of the
http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wfs[OGC Web Feature Service
specification]. Notable features:

* Official OGC reference implementation for WFS 1.1.0 and WFS 2.0.0
Simple
* Implements WFS standards 1.0.0, 1.1.0 and 2.0.0footnote:[Passes OGC
WFS CITE test suites (including all optional tests)]
* Fully transactional (even for rich data models)
* Supports KVP, XML and SOAP requests
* GML 2/3.0/3.1/3.2 output/input
* Support for GetGmlObject requests and XLinks
* High performance and excellent scalability
* On-the-fly coordinate transformation
* Designed for rich data models from the bottom up
* Backends support flexible mapping of GML application schemas to
relational models
* ISO 19107-compliant geometry model: Complex geometries (e.g.
non-linear curves)
* Advanced filter expression support based on XPath 1.0
* Supports numerous backends, such as PostGIS, Oracle Spatial, MS SQL
Server, Shapefiles or GML instance documents

TIP: In order to learn the setup and configuration of a deegree-based WFS, we
recommend to read chapters <<anchor-installation>> and
<<anchor-lightly>> first. Check out <<anchor-workspace-inspire>> and
<<anchor-workspace-utah>> for example deegree WFS configurations.
Continue with <<anchor-configuration-basics>> and
<<anchor-configuration-wfs>>.

=== Characteristics of deegree WMS

deegree WMS is an implementation of the
http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wms[OGC Web Map Service
specification]. Notable features:

* Official OGC reference implementation for WMS 1.1.1
* Implements WMS standards 1.1.1 and 1.3.0footnote:[Passes OGC WMS CITE
test suites (including all optional tests)]
* Extensive support for styling languages SLD/SE versions 1.0.0 and
1.1.0
* Supports KVP, XML and SOAP requests (WMS 1.3.0)
* High performance and excellent scalability
* High quality rendering
* Scale dependent styling
* Support for SE removes the need for a lot of proprietary extensions
* Easy configuration of HTML and other output formats for GetFeatureInfo
responses
* Uses stream-based data access, minimal memory footprint
* Nearly complete support for raster symbolizing as defined in SE (with
some extensions)
* Complete support for TIME/ELEVATION and other dimensions for both
feature and raster data
* Supports numerous backends, such as PostGIS, Oracle Spatial,
Shapefiles or GML instance documents
* Can render rich data models directly

TIP: In order to learn the setup and configuration of a deegree-based WMS, we
recommend to read chapters <<anchor-installation>> and
<<anchor-lightly>> first. Check out <<anchor-workspace-utah>> and
<<anchor-workspace-inspire>> for example deegree WMS configurations.
Continue with <<anchor-configuration-basics>> and
<<anchor-configuration-wms>>.

=== Characteristics of deegree WMTS

deegree WMTS is an implementation of the
http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts[OGC Web Map Tile Service
specification]. Notable features:

* Implements Basic WMTS standard 1.0.0 (KVP)
* High performance and excellent scalability
* Supports different backends, such as GeoTIFF, remote WMS or file
system tile image hierarchies
* Supports on-the-fly caching (using EHCache)
* Supports GetFeatureInfo for remote WMS backends

TIP: In order to learn the setup and configuration of a deegree-based WMTS,
we recommend to read <<anchor-installation>> and <<anchor-lightly>>
first. Continue with <<anchor-configuration-basics>> and
<<anchor-configuration-wmts>>.

=== Characteristics of deegree CSW

deegree CSW is an implementation of the
http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/cat[OGC Catalogue Service
specification]. Notable features:

* Implements CSW standard 2.0.2
* Fully transactional
* Supports KVP, XML and SOAP requests
* High performance and excellent scalability
* ISO Metadata Application Profile 1.0.0
* Pluggable and modular dataaccess layer allows to add support for new
APs and backends
* Modular inspector architecture allows to validate records to be
inserted against various criteria
* Standard inspectors: schema validity, identifier integrity, INSPIRE
requirements
* Handles all defined queryable properties (for Dublin Core as well as
ISO profile)
* Complex filter expressions

TIP: In order to learn the setup and configuration of a deegree-based CSW, we
recommend to read <<anchor-installation>> and <<anchor-lightly>> first.
Check out <<anchor-workspace-csw>> for an example deegree CSW
configuration. Continue with <<anchor-configuration-basics>> and
<<anchor-configuration-csw>>.

=== Characteristics of deegree WPS
