== Installation

=== System requirements

deegree webservices work on any platform with a compatible Java SE 8
installation, including:

* Microsoft Windows
* Linux
* Mac OS X
* Solaris

Supported Java SE 8 versions are
http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Oracle
JDK 8]footnote:[Oracle JDK 7 and earlier versions are not supported
anymore, be aware that those versions are out of maintenance and reached
End-of-life.], http://openjdk.java.net[OpenJDK 8]footnote:[OpenJDK
binaries are provided by https://www.azul.com/downloads/zulu/[Azul
Systems] or https://adoptopenjdk.net[AdoptOpenJDK].]. Newer Java SE
versions may work, but are not officially supported by the deegree
development team.

=== Downloading

deegree webservices downloads are available on the
http://www.deegree.org[deegree home page]. You have the choice between:

* _Docker_ : Docker Image with deegree webservices on OpenJDK and Apache
Tomcatfootnote:[Requires an installation of Docker Community or
Enterprise Edition, download Docker from
https://www.docker.com/[www.docker.com].]
* _WAR_: Generic Java Web Archive for deployment in an existing Java
Servlet containerfootnote:[A Java Servlet 2.5 compliant container is
required. We recommend using the latest http://tomcat.apache.org/[Apache
Tomcat 8] release.]
* _ZIP_: Distribution bundle with Apache Tomcatfootnote:[As of deegree
3.4.0 the ZIP distribution bundle is deprecated and the download links
are removed from the website. Download the ZIP from the
http://repo.deegree.org/content/groups/public/org/deegree/deegree-webservices-tomcat-bundle/[Nexus
repository] instead.]

TIP: If you are confused by the two options and unsure which version to pick,
use the ZIP. Both variants contain exactly the same deegree software,
they only differ in packaging.

=== Starting and stopping

In order to run the ZIP version, extract it into a directory of your
choice. Afterwards, fire up the included start script for your operating
system:

* Microsoft Windows: `+start-deegree-windows+`
* Linux/Solaris: `+start-deegree-linux.sh+` (when starting via a Desktop
Environment such as Gnome, choose "Run in terminal")
* Mac OS X: `+start-deegree-osx.cmd+`

You should now see a terminal window on your screen with a lot of log
messages:

image::terminal.png[deegree webservices starting
up,scaledwidth=50.0%]

TIP: If you don't see this terminal window, make sure that the `+java+`
command is on the system path. You can verify this by entering
`+java -version+` at the command prompt. Also ensure that `+JAVA_HOME+`
system environment variable points to the correct installation directory
of a compatible JDK.

You may minimize this window, but don't close it as long as you want to
be able to use the deegree webservices. In order to check if the
services are actually running, open http://localhost:8080 in your
browser. You should see the following page:

image::console_start.png[deegree webservices administration
console,scaledwidth=50.0%]

To shut deegree webservices down, switch back to the terminal window and
press `+CTRL+C+` or simply close it.

TIP: If you want to run deegree webservices on system startup automatically,
consider installing http://tomcat.apache.org[Apache Tomcat 8] as a
system service. Afterwards, download the WAR version of deegree
webservices and deploy it into your Tomcat installation (e.g. by copying
the WAR file into the `+webapps+` folder). Consult the
https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/index.html[Tomcat
documentation] for more information and options.

=== Securing deegree

Most weaknesses in deegree come from incorrect or inappropriate
configuration. It is nearly always possible to make deegree more secure
than the default out of the box configuration. The following documents
best practices and recommendations on securing a production deegree
server, whether it be hosted on a Windows or Unix based operating
system.

==== Software Versions

The first step is to make sure you are running the latest stable
releases of software:

* Operating System including the latest updates and security patches
* Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or JDK
* Apache Tomcat, Jetty or your preferred Java Servlet container
* Third-party libraries such as GDAL, JDBC driver, and
* deegree webservices itself.

TIP: If you are running Apache Tomcat we recommend that you read and apply
all recommendations as documented in
https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/security-howto.html[Apache
Tomcat Security Considerations].

==== Encryption

When operating deegree in a production environment enable HTTPS with SSL
or TLS. Either enable HTTPS on your Java Servlet Container or operate it
behind a web server such as Apache httpd oder NGINX.

TIP: If you are running Apache Tomcat read the
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/ssl-howto.html[SSL HowTo].

==== Securing deegree console and REST API

It is as a huge security problem to operate the deegree web app without
setting a password for the deegree console. How to set the password for
the deegree console is described in `+anchor-configuration-basics+`. The
same applies to the deegree REST API. Since both transfer the
credentials as clear text (with a little bit of obscurity) it is highly
recommended to enable encryption on the protocol level as described
above! For further information how to protect the deegree REST API read
more in `+anchor-configuration-restapi+`. You should also consider to
limit the access to both resources. Apply a filter by IP or hostname to
only allow a subset of machines to connect and access the deegree
console and REST API.

WARNING: The deegree console provides access to the server file system. Therefore
you must not operate the Java Servlet container as root user!
Furthermore you should consider to enable the Java Security Manager and
define restrictive file permissions.footnote:[How to run securely Java
applications we recommend to follow the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/security/index.html[Java
Security Guidelines] and for
http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/security-manager-howto.html[Apache
Tomcat the Security Manager HowTo].]
