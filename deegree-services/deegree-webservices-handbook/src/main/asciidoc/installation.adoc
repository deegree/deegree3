=== System requirements

deegree webservices work on any platform with a compatible Java SE 11
installation, including:

* Microsoft Windows
* Linux
* macOS

Supported Java SE 11 versions are
https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java11[Oracle JDK 11]
footnote:[Oracle JDK 8 and later requires a subscription from Oracle for use in production environments. Read further in https://www.oracle.com/java/java-se-subscription/[Oracle Java SE subscription].] and https://openjdk.org/projects/jdk/11/[OpenJDK 11]
footnote:[OpenJDK binaries are provided by https://www.azul.com/downloads/#zulu[Azul Systems]
or https://adoptium.net/[Eclipse Temurin].].

NOTE: Newer Java SE versions such as the LTS versions 17 are currently not supported by deegree 3.5. Please check out our wiki page https://github.com/deegree/deegree3/wiki/End-of-Life-and-Support-Matrix[End of Life and Support Matrix] for further information.

=== Downloading

deegree webservices downloads are available on the
https://www.deegree.org/download/[deegree home page]. You have the choice between:

* _Docker_ : Docker Image with deegree webservices on OpenJDK and Apache
Tomcat footnote:[Requires an installation of Docker Community or
Enterprise Edition, download Docker from
https://www.docker.com/[www.docker.com].]
* _WAR_: Generic Java Web Archive for deployment in an existing Java
Servlet container footnote:[A Java Servlet 3.1 compliant container is
required. We recommend using the latest https://tomcat.apache.org/[Apache
Tomcat 9] release.]

TIP: If you are confused by the options and unsure which version to pick,
use the WAR. All variants contain exactly the same deegree webservices webapp,
they only differ in packaging.

=== Starting and stopping

In order to run the WAR version, move it into the local deployment directory of your Java Servlet container. For Apache Tomcat this is the directory _$CATALINA_HOME/webapps_. Afterwards, start the Java Servlet container. To start Apache Tomcat open a terminal and change to the directory _$CATALINA_HOME/bin_ and fire up the included start script for your operating system _startup.sh_ for Linux or _startup.bat_ for Windows.

TIP: If you deploy the WAR into
a web container, you most probably will have to use a different URL for
accessing the deegree console and webservices, e.g.
http://localhost:8080/deegree-webservices-${project.version}. The port
number and webapp name depend on your installation and deployment setup.
In the following the base URL http://localhost:8080/deegree-webservices without the version number will be used. You may rename the WAR file from _deegree-webservices-${project.version}.war_ to _deegree-webservices.war_ before deploying it.

You should now see a terminal window on your screen with a lot of log
messages:

.deegree webservices starting up
image::terminal.png[deegree webservices starting up,scaledwidth=50.0%]

TIP: If the application isn't starting, make sure that the _java_
command is on the system path. You can verify this by entering
_java -version_ at the command prompt. Also ensure that _JAVA_HOME_
system environment variable points to the correct installation directory
of a compatible JDK.

You may minimize the terminal window, but don't close it as long as you want to
be able to use the deegree webservices. In order to check if the
services are actually running, open http://localhost:8080/deegree-webservices in your
browser. You should see the following page:

.deegree webservices administration console
image::console_start.png[deegree webservices administration console,scaledwidth=50.0%]

To shut deegree webservices down, switch back to the terminal window and
press _CTRL+c_ or simply close it.

TIP: If you want to run deegree webservices on system startup automatically,
consider installing https://tomcat.apache.org[Apache Tomcat 9] as a
system service. Consult the https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/index.html[Tomcat documentation]
for more information and options.

=== Securing deegree

Most weaknesses in deegree come from incorrect or inappropriate
configuration. It is nearly always possible to make deegree more secure
than the default out of the box configuration. The following documents
best practices and recommendations on securing a production deegree
server, whether it be hosted on a Windows or Unix based operating
system.

==== Software Versions

The first step is to make sure you are running the latest stable
releases of software:

* Operating System including the latest updates and security patches
* Java Runtime Environment (JRE) or JDK
* Apache Tomcat, Jetty or your preferred Java Servlet container
* Third-party libraries such as GDAL, JDBC driver, and
* deegree webservices itself.

TIP: If you are running Apache Tomcat we recommend that you read and apply
all recommendations as documented in
https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/security-howto.html[Apache Tomcat Security Considerations].

==== Encryption

When operating deegree in a production environment enable HTTPS with SSL
or TLS. Either enable HTTPS on your Java Servlet Container or operate it
behind a web server such as Apache httpd oder NGINX.

TIP: If you are running Apache Tomcat read the
https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-9.0-doc/ssl-howto.html[SSL HowTo].

==== Securing deegree console and REST API

It is as a huge security problem to operate the deegree web application without
setting a password for the deegree console. How to set the password for
the deegree console is described in <<anchor-configuration-basics>>. The
same applies to the deegree REST API. Since both transfer the
credentials as clear text (with a little bit of obscurity) it is highly
recommended to enable encryption on the protocol level as described
above! For further information how to protect the deegree REST API read
more in <<anchor-configuration-restapi>>. You should also consider to
limit the access to both resources. Apply a filter by IP or hostname to
only allow a subset of machines to connect and access the deegree
console and REST API.

WARNING: The deegree console provides access to the server file system. Therefore,
you must not operate the Java Servlet container as root user!
Furthermore, you should consider to enable the Java Security Manager and
define restrictive file permissions.footnote:[How to run securely Java
applications we recommend to follow the
