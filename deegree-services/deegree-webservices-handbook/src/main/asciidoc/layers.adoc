== Map layers

A (map) layer defines how to combine a data store and a style resource
into a map. Each layer resource can be used to define one or more
layers. The layers can be used in theme definitions, and depend on
various data source and style resources. This chapter assumes you've
already configured a data source and a style for your layer (although a
style is not strictly needed; some layer types can do without, and
others can render in a default style when none is given).

.Layer resources define how data store and style resources are combined

=== Common configuration

Most layer configurations follow a similar structure. That's why some of
the common components are exactly the same across configurations
(they're even in common namespaces). In this section these common
elements are described first, the subsequent chapters describe the
different layer types.

[[description]]
==== Description metadata

The description section is used to describe textual metadata which
occurs in almost all objects. This includes elements such as title,
abstract and so on. The format which is being described here is capable
of multilingualism, but processing multilingual strings is not supported
yet (you can still define it, though).

The commonly used prefix for these elements is _d_. Let's have a look
at an example:

[source,xml]
----
<d:Title>My Roads Layer</d:Title>
<d:Abstract>This is my roads layer, which I configured myself. I had no help but the deegree webservices handbook.</d:Abstract>
<d:Keywords>
  <d:Keyword>deegree</d:Keyword>
  <d:Keyword>transportation</d:Keyword>
  <d:Type codeSpace='none'>unknown</d:Type>
</d:Keywords>
----

All elements support the _lang_ attribute to specify the language, and
all elements may occur multiple times (including the _Keywords_
element).

[[spatial]]
==== Spatial metadata

The spatial metadata is used to describe coordinate systems and
envelopes. Typically, the layers can retrieve the native coordinate
system and envelope from the data source, but sometimes it may be
desirable to define a special extent, or add more coordinate systems. In
the example configurations, the prefix _s_ is used for spatial
metadata elements, so it is used here as well:

[source,xml]
----
<s:Envelope crs='EPSG:25832'>
  <s:LowerCorner>204485 5204122</s:LowerCorner>
  <s:UpperCorner>1008600 6134557</s:UpperCorner>
</s:Envelope>
<s:CRS>EPSG:25832 EPSG:31466 EPSG:4326</s:CRS>
----

As you can see, the envelope is specified in a specific CRS. If the
attribute is omitted, EPSG:4326 is assumed. The CRS element may include
multiple codes, separated by whitespace.

[[common]]
==== Common layer options

This sections describes a set of common layer options. Not all options
make sense for all layers, but most of them do.

The namespace for the elements (newly) defined in this section is
commonly bound to the _l_ character. Let's have a look at the options
available:

[width="100%",cols="23%,13%,18%,46%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|Name |1 |String |The unique identifier of the layer

|_Description_ |0..1 |Several |The link:#description[description]
elements described above

|_Spatial metadata_ |0..1 |Several |The link:#spatial[spatial] metadata
elements described above

|MetadataSetId |0..1 |String |A metadata set id by which this layer is
identified

|ScaleDenominators |0..1 |Empty |Used to define scale constraints on the
layer

|Dimension |0..n |Complex |Used to configure extra dimensions for the
layer

|StyleRef |0..n |Complex |Used to reference one or more styles

|LayerOptions |0..1 |Complex |Used to configure rendering behaviour
|===

The _MetadataSetId_ is used in the WMS to export a MetadataURL based
on a template. Please refer to the WMS configuration for details on how
to configure this.

The _ScaleDenominators_ element has _min_ and _max_ attributes
which define the constraints in WMS 1.3.0 scale denominators (based on
0.28mm pixel size).

===== Layer dimensions

The WMS specification supports extra dimensions (besides the spatial
extent) for layers, such as elevation, time or other custom dimensions.
Since the support must be present at the layer level, this must be
configured on the layer in deegree. The _Dimension_ element can have
the attributes _isTime_ and _isElevation_ to indicate that you're
defining the standard time/elevation dimension. If none is given, you'll
have to specify the _Name_ element. Let's see what you can configure
here:

[width="100%",cols="19%,12%,16%,53%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|Name |0..1 |String |The dimension name, if not elevation or time

|Source |1 |String/QName |The data source of the dimension

|DefaultValue |0..1 |String |Specify a default value to be used, default
is none

|MultipleValues |0..1 |Boolean |Whether multiple values are supported,
default is false

|NearestValue |0..1 |Boolean |Whether jumping to the nearest value is
supported, default is false

|Current |0..1 |Boolean |Whether _current_ is supported for time,
default is false

|Units |0..1 |String |What units this dimension uses. Mandatory for non
time/elevation

|UnitSymbol |0..1 |String |What unit symbol to use. Mandatory for non
time/elevation

|Extent |1 |String |The extent of the dimension
|===

Please note that for feature layers, the _Source_ element content must
be a qualified property name.

To understand how the omission or specification of the various optional
elements here affect the WMS protocol behaviour, it is recommended to
read up on the WMS 1.3.0 specification. The deegree WMS is going to
behave according to what the spec says it must do (what to do in case a
default value is available or not etc.). The format for the values and
the extent is also identical to that used for requests/in the spec.

===== Layer styles

You can configure any number of _StyleRef_ elements. Each corresponds
to exactly one style store configuration, specified by the subelement
_StyleStoreId_. The only other allowed subelement is the _Style_
element, which can be used to extract/rename specific styles from the
style store. If omitted, all styles matching the layers' name are used.
Let's have a look at an example snippet:

[source,xml]
----
<l:StyleRef>
  <l:StyleStoreId>roads_style</l:StyleStoreId>
</l:StyleRef>
----

Here's a snippet with _Style_ elements:

PLEASE NOTE: The following mechanisms using StyleName LayerNameRef and
StyleNameRef elements will only work with SLD files. Using direct SE
styles, the only way to configure styles is the above.

[source,xml]
----
<l:StyleRef>
  <l:StyleStoreId>road_styles</l:StyleStoreId>
  <l:Style>
  ...
  </l:Style>
  <l:Style>
  ...
  </l:Style>
</l:StyleRef>
----

If a _Style_ element is specified, you must first specify what style
you want extracted:

[source,xml]
----
<l:Style>
  <l:StyleName>highways</l:StyleName>
  <l:LayerNameRef>highways</l:LayerNameRef>
  <l:StyleNameRef>highways</l:StyleNameRef>
  ...
</l:Style>
----

The _StyleName_ specifies the name under which the style will be known
in the WMS. The _LayerNameRef_ and _StyleNameRef_ are used to
extract the style from the style store.

The next part to configure within the _Style_ element is the legend
generation, if you don't want to use the default legend generated from
the rendering style. You can either specify a different style from the
style store to use for legend generation, or you can specify an external
graphic. Referencing a different legend style is straightforward:

[source,xml]
----
<l:Style>
...
  <l:LegendStyle>
    <l:LayerNameRef>highways</l:LayerNameRef>
    <l:StyleNameRef>highways_legend</l:StyleNameRef>
  </l:LegendStyle>
</l:Style>
----

With specifying the external graphic, you have the option of referencing
a local file, or referencing a remote URL. Specifying a file is
straightforward, and will result in the contents of that file being used
as legend:

[source,xml]
----
<l:Style>
...
  <l:LegendGraphic>legendimages/mylegend.png</l:LegendGraphic>
</l:Style>
----

If you specify an HTTP URL instead of a relative path the behaviour is
the same by default, the remote images' content is used as legend. If
you set the optional attribute _outputGetLegendGraphicUrl_ to
_false_ (it's true by default), the specified URL is written as
_LegendURL_ in the WMS capabilities (the behaviour for
_GetLegendGraphic_ requests is the same anyway):

[source,xml]
----
<l:Style>
...
  <l:LegendGraphic outputGetLegendGraphicUrl="false">http://legends.acme.com/menu.png</l:LegendGraphic>
</l:Style>
----

A full example you will find below:

[source,xml]
----
<l:StyleRef>
<l:StyleStoreId>road_styles</l:StyleStoreId>
  <l:Style>
    <l:StyleName>highways</l:StyleName>
    <l:LayerNameRef>highways</l:LayerNameRef>
    <l:StyleNameRef>highways</l:StyleNameRef>
    <l:LegendGraphic outputGetLegendGraphicUrl="false">http://legends.acme.com/menu.png</l:LegendGraphic>
  </l:Style>
  <l:Style>
    <l:LegendStyle>
      <l:LayerNameRef>highways</l:LayerNameRef>
      <l:StyleNameRef>highways_legend</l:StyleNameRef>
    </l:LegendStyle>
  </l:Style>
</l:StyleRef>
----

===== Rendering options

The rendering options are basically the same as the WMS layer options.
Here's a copy of the corresponding table for reference:

[width="100%",cols="18%,12%,7%,63%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |String |Description
|AntiAliasing |0..1 |String |Whether to antialias NONE, TEXT, IMAGE or
BOTH, default is BOTH

|RenderingQuality |0..1 |String |Whether to render LOW, NORMAL or HIGH
quality, default is HIGH

|Interpolation |0..1 |String |Whether to use BILINEAR, NEARESTNEIGHBOUR
or BICUBIC interpolation, default is NEARESTNEIGHBOUR

|MaxFeatures |0..1 |Integer |Maximum number of features to render at
once, default is 10000

|FeatureInfo |0..1 |None |attribute _enabled_: if false, feature info is
disabled (default is true)

|FeatureInfo |0..1 |None |attribute _pixelRadius_: Number of pixels to
consider when doing GetFeatureInfo, default is 1
|===

Here is an example snippet:

[source,xml]
----
<l:LayerOptions>
  <l:AntiAliasing>TEXT</l:AntiAliasing>
</l:LayerOptions>
----

[[anchor-configuration-feature-layers]]
=== Feature layers

Feature layers are layers based on a feature store. You can have
multiple layers defined in a feature layers configuration, each based on
feature types from the same feature store.

You have two choices to configure feature layers. One option is to try
to have deegree figure out what layers to configure by itself, the other
is to manually define all the layers you want. Having deegree do the
configuration automatically has the obvious advantage that the
configuration is minimal, with the disadvantage of lacking flexibility.

==== Auto layers

This configuration only involves to specify what feature store to use,
and optionally, what styles. Let's have a look at an example:

[source,xml]
----
<FeatureLayers xmlns='http://www.deegree.org/layers/feature' 
               xmlns:d='http://www.deegree.org/metadata/description'
               xmlns:s='http://www.deegree.org/metadata/spatial'
               xmlns:l='http://www.deegree.org/layers/base'
               configVersion='3.4.0'>

  <AutoLayers>
    <FeatureStoreId>myfeaturestore</FeatureStoreId>
    <StyleStoreId>style1</StyleStoreId>
    <StyleStoreId>style2</StyleStoreId>
  </AutoLayers>

</FeatureLayers>
----

This will create one layer for each (concrete) feature type in the
feature store. If no style stores are configured, the default style will
be used for all layers. If style stores are configured, matching styles
will be automatically used if available. So if you have a feature type
with (local) name _Autos_, deegree will check all configured style
stores for styles identified by layer name _Autos_ and use them, if
available. The name _Autos_ will be used as name and title as
appropriate, and spatial metadata will be used as available from the
feature store.

==== Manual configuration

The basic structure of a manual configuration looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<FeatureLayers xmlns='http://www.deegree.org/layers/feature' 
               xmlns:d='http://www.deegree.org/metadata/description'
               xmlns:s='http://www.deegree.org/metadata/spatial'
               xmlns:l='http://www.deegree.org/layers/base'
               configVersion='3.4.0'>
  <FeatureStoreId>myfeaturestore</FeatureStoreId>
  <FeatureLayer>
  ...
  </FeatureLayer>
  <FeatureLayer>
  ...
  </FeatureLayer>
</FeatureLayers>
----

As you can see, the first thing to do is to bind the configuration to a
feature store. After that, you can define one or more feature layers.

A feature layer configuration has three optional elements besides the
common elements. The _FeatureType_ can be used to restrict a layer to
a specific feature type (use a qualified name). The _Filter_ element
can be used to specify a filter that applies to the layer globally (use
standard OGC filter encoding 1.1.0 _ogc:Filter_ element within):

[source,xml]
----
<FeatureLayer>
  <FeatureType xmlns:app='http://www.deegree.org/app'>app:Roads</FeatureType>
  <Filter>
    <Filter xmlns='http://www.opengis.net/ogc'>
      <PropertyIsEqualTo>
        <PropertyName xmlns:app='http://www.deegree.org/app'>app:type</PropertyName>
        <Literal>123</Literal>
      </PropertyIsEqualTo>
    </Filter>
  </Filter>
  ...
</FeatureLayer>
----

The third extra option is the _SortBy_ element, which can be used to
influence the order in which features are drawn:

[source,xml]
----
<FeatureLayer>
  ...
  <SortBy reverseFeatureInfo="false">
    <SortBy xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/ogc">
      <SortProperty>
        <PropertyName xmlns:app="http://www.deegree.org/app">app:level</PropertyName>
      </SortProperty>
    </SortBy>
  </SortBy>
  ...
</FeatureLayer>
----

The attribute _reverseFeatureInfo_ is false by default. If set to
true, the feature that is drawn first will appear *last* in a
_GetFeatureInfo_ feature collection.

After that the standard options follow, as outlined in the
link:#common[common] section.

=== Tile layers

Tile layers are based on tile data sets. You can configure an unlimited
number of tile layers each based on several different tile data sets
within one configuration file.

As you might have guessed, most of the common parameters are ignored for
this layer type. Most notably, the style and dimension configuration is
ignored.

In most cases, a configuration like the following is sufficient:

[source,xml]
----
<TileLayers xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/layers/tile"
            xmlns:d="http://www.deegree.org/metadata/description" 
            xmlns:l="http://www.deegree.org/layers/base"
            configVersion="3.4.0">
  <TileLayer>
    <l:Name>example</l:Name>
    <d:Title>Example INSPIRE layer</d:Title>
    <TileDataSet tileStoreId="sometilestore">roads</TileDataSet>
    <TileDataSet tileStoreId="sometilestore4326">roads</TileDataSet>
  </TileLayer>
</TileLayers>
----

Just repeat the _TileLayer_ element once for each layer you wish to
configure.

Please note that each tile data set needs to be configured with a unique
tile matrix set within one layer. It is currently not possible (let's
say it's not advisable) to configure two tile data sets based on the
same tile matrix set within one layer, even if their actual data does
not overlap.

If used in a WMTS, the WMTS capabilities will contain only the actually
used tile matrix sets, and will contain appropriate links in the layers
which have been configured with fitting tile data sets.

=== Coverage layers

Coverage layers are based on coverages out of coverage stores. Similar
to feature layers, you can choose between an automatic layer setup and a
manual configuration.

==== Auto layers

All you need to configure is the coverage store and an optional style
store:

[source,xml]
----
<CoverageLayers xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/layers/coverage"
                xmlns:d="http://www.deegree.org/metadata/description"
                xmlns:l="http://www.deegree.org/layers/base"
                configVersion="3.4.0">
  <AutoLayers>
    <CoverageStoreId>dem</CoverageStoreId>
    <StyleStoreId>heightmap</StyleStoreId>
  </AutoLayers>
</CoverageLayers>
----

In theory this would add one layer for each coverage in the coverage
store, but since only one coverage is supported per coverage store at
the moment, only one layer will be the result. If a style store is
specified, all styles matching the layer name (the coverage store id)
will be available for the layer.

==== Manual configuration

The manual configuration requires the definition of a coverage store,
and one or many coverage layer definitions:

[source,xml]
----
<CoverageLayers xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/layers/coverage"
                xmlns:d="http://www.deegree.org/metadata/description"
                xmlns:l="http://www.deegree.org/layers/base"
                configVersion="3.4.0">
  <CoverageStoreId>dem</CoverageStoreId>
  <CoverageLayer>
  <!-- standard layer options -->
  </CoverageLayer>
</CoverageLayers>
----

Within the _CoverageLayer_ element you can only define the
link:#common[common] layer options. While only one coverage is supported
per coverage store, it might still be desirable to define multiple
layers based on the store, for example one layer per style.

=== Remote WMS layers

Remote WMS layers are based on layers requested from another WMS on the
network. In its simplest mode, the remote WMS layer store will provide
all layers that the other WMS offers, but you can pick out and restrict
the configuration to single layers if you want. The link:#common[common]
style and dimension options are not used in this layer configuration.

The remote WMS layer configuration is always based on a single
_RemoteWMS_ resource, so the most basic configuration which cascades
all available layers looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<RemoteWMSLayers xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/layers/remotewms" configVersion="3.4.0">
  <RemoteWMSId>d3</RemoteWMSId>
  <!-- more detailed options would follow here -->
</RemoteWMSLayers>
----

In many cases that's already sufficient, but if you wish to control the
way the requests are being sent, you can specify the _RequestOptions_.
If you want to limit/restrict the layers, you can specify any amount of
_Layer_ elements.

[[anchor-configuration-layer-request-options]]
==== Request options

Use the _ImageFormat_ element to indicate which format should be
requested from the remote WMS. Set the attribute _transparent_ to
_false_ if you don't want to request transparent images. Default is to
request transparent _image/png_ maps:

[source,xml]
----
<RequestOptions>
  <ImageFormat transparent='false'>image/gif</ImageFormat>
</RequestOptions>
----

The _DefaultCRS_ element can be used to specify the CRS to request. If
the _useAlways_ attribute is true, maps are always requested in this
format, and transformed if necessary. If set to false (the default), the
requested CRS will be requested from the remote service if available. If
a requested CRS is not available from the remote service, the value of
this option is used, and the resulting image transformed.

The _Parameter_ element can be used (multiple times) to add and/or fix
KVP parameter values used in requests to the remote service. The
_name_ attribute (which is required) configures which parameter you're
talking about, and the content specifies a default or fixed value. The
_use_ and _scope_ attributes can be used to specify how to handle
parameters. Have a look at the following table for default and possible
values of these attributes:

[width="87%",cols="25%,28%,47%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Default |Possible values
|use |allowOverride |allowOverride, fixed
|scope |All |GetMap, GetFeatureInfo, All
|===

Let's have a look at a couple of examples:

[source,xml]
----
<RequestOptions>
  <Parameter name='BGCOLOR'>#00ff00</Parameter>
<RequestOptions>
----

This means that all maps are requested with a background color of green,
unless the request overrides it. GetFeatureInfo requests will also have
the BGCOLOR parameter set, although it makes no difference there.

Another example:

[source,xml]
----
<RequestOptions>
  <Parameter name='USERNAME'>SEC_ADMIN</Parameter>
  <Parameter name='PASSWORD'>JOSE67</Parameter>
</RequestOptions>
----

In this case all requests will have USERNAME and PASSWORD set to these
values. Users can still override these values in requests.

A last example:

[source,xml]
----
<RequestOptions>
  <Parameter scope='GetMap' name='BGCOLOR'>#00ff00</Parameter>
  <Parameter use='fixed' name='USERNAME'>SEC_ADMIN</Parameter>
  <Parameter use='fixed' name='PASSWORD'>JOSE67</Parameter>
</RequestOptions>
----

Now all GetMap requests will have the USERNAME and PASSWORD parameters
hard coded to the configured values, with the BGCOLOR parameter set to
green by default, but with the possibility of override by the user.
GetFeatureInfo requests will only have the USERNAME and PASSWORD
parameters fixed to the configured values.

==== Layer configuration

The manual configuration allows you to pick out a layer, rename it, and
optionally override the _common description and spatial metadata. What
you don't override, will be copied from the source. Let's look at an
example:

[source,xml]
----
<RemoteWMSLayers>
  ...
  <Layer>
    <OriginalName>cite:BasicPolygons</OriginalName>
    <Name>basic_polygons</Name>
    <!-- optionally override description (title, abstract, keywords) -->
    <!-- optionally override envelope, crs -->
    <!-- optionally set layer options -->
  </Layer>
</RemoteWMSLayers>
----

Please note that once you specify one layer, you'll need to specify each
layer you want to make available. If you want all layers to be
available, don't specify a _Layer_ element. Of course, you can specify
as many _Layer_ elements as you like.
