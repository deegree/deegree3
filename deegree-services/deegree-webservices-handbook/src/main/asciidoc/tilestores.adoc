== Tile stores

Tile stores are resources that provide access to pre-rendered map tiles.
The common use case for tile stores is to provide data for tile layers.

The remainder of this chapter describes some relevant terms and the tile
store configuration files in detail. You can access this configuration
level by clicking on the *tile stores* link in the administration
console. The configuration files are located in the *datasources/tile/*
directory of the deegree workspace.

=== Tile stores, tile data sets and tile matrix sets

A tile store is what you configure in a single tile store configuration
file. It defines one or more (stored) tile data sets. Other resources
such as the tile layer configuration usually refer to a specific tile
data set from a tile store.

The structure of a tile data set is determined by specifying the
identifier of a tile matrix set. Most often, one wants to define tile
data sets that conform to a pre-defined tile matrix set. In that case,
one only has to provide the tile store configuration file.

The term tile matrix set has been coined deliberately to coincide with
the same term from the http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wmts[WMTS
specification] and refers to structure and spatial properties of the
tile matrix. The tile matrix sets (or "quads") from WMTS 1.0.0 and
INSPIRE ViewService 3.1 specifications are already predefined, but
additional tile matrix sets may be defined as well (see below).

Take note that it is not necessary to provide actual tiles for all tiles
defined within the tile matrix set, a tile data set may contain a
subset. The only requirement is that you need to fulfill the structure
requirements (CRS, size of tiles, position of tiles in world
coordinates, scale).

==== Pre-defined tile matrix sets

The following table lists the tile matrix sets that are pre-defined in
deegree:

[width="100%",cols="20%,17%,34%,29%",options="header",]
|===
|Workspace identifier |Name in specification |URN |Specification

|globalcrs84scale |GlobalCRS84Scale
|urn:ogc:def:wkss:OGC:1.0:GlobalCRS84Scale |OGC WMTS 1.0.0

Specification 3.1
|===

You can override these standard definitions by placing an appropriately
named file into the _datasources/tile/tilematrixset/_ directory of
your workspace. It is recommended to always use lower case file names to
avoid confusion.

==== User-defined tile matrix sets

There are currently two ways to configure tile matrix sets. The first
way is to state the structure of the matrices explicitly (described
here), the second will extract the structure from a tiled GeoTIFF
(BIGTIFF) file (possibly with overlays, described in the GeoTIFF
section).

Like everything else in the deegree workspace, defining a tile matrix
set means placing a configuration file into a standard location, in this
case the _datasources/tile/tilematrixset_ directory.

Let's have a look at an example for the explicit configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<TileMatrixSet xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/datasource/tile/tilematrixset" configVersion="3.4.0">

  <CRS>urn:ogc:def:crs:OGC:1.3:CRS84</CRS>

  <TileMatrix>
    <Identifier>1e6</Identifier>
    <ScaleDenominator>1e6</ScaleDenominator>
    <TopLeftCorner>-180 84</TopLeftCorner>
    <TileWidth>256</TileWidth>
    <TileHeight>256</TileHeight>
    <MatrixWidth>60000</MatrixWidth>
    <MatrixHeight>50000</MatrixHeight>
  </TileMatrix>
  <TileMatrix>
    <Identifier>2.5e6</Identifier>
    <ScaleDenominator>2.5e6</ScaleDenominator>
    <TopLeftCorner>-180 84</TopLeftCorner>
    <TileWidth>256</TileWidth>
    <TileHeight>256</TileHeight>
    <MatrixWidth>9000</MatrixWidth>
    <MatrixHeight>7000</MatrixHeight>
  </TileMatrix>

</TileMatrixSet>
----

As you can see, the format is almost identical to the one from the WMTS
capabilities documents. A tile matrix set is always defined for a single
coordinate system, and contains one or more tile matrices. Each tile
matrix has an identifier, a specific scale, an origin (the top left
corner in world coordinates), defines a tile width/height in pixels and
specifies how many tiles there are in x and y direction.

You do not need to explicitly specify the envelope, it will be
calculated automatically from the values you provide. Keep in mind that
the conversion between scale and resolution uses the WMTS conversion
factor of approx. 111319 in case of degree based coordinate systems
(that's important so the envelope is calculated correctly).

=== GeoTIFF tile store

The GeoTIFF tile store can be used to configure tile data sets based on
GeoTIFF/BIGTIFF files. The tile store is currently read-only. The
requirements for the GeoTIFFs are:

* it must be created as BIGTIFF (eg. with GDAL using the
_-co BIGTIFF=YES_ option)
* it must be created as a tiled tiff (eg. with GDAL using the
_-co TILED=YES_ option)
* it can contain overviews (it is best to use a recent GDAL version >=
1.8.0, where you can use _GDAL_TIFF_OVR_BLOCKSIZE_ to specify the
overview tile size)
* it is recommended that the overviews contain the same tile size as the
main level
* it must contain the envelope as GeoTIFF tags in the tiff (don't use
world files)
* it is recommended that the CRS is contained as GeoTIFF tag (but can be
overridden in the tile matrix set config, see below)

To make it easy to create a WMTS based on a GeoTIFF, a tile matrix set
can be generated from the GeoTIFF structure, using the method described
further down. But if you manage to generate your TIFF files to fit the
structure of another matrix set it is just as well (the envelope of the
GeoTIFF can be a subset of the tile matrix set's envelope).

Let's have a look at an example configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<GeoTIFFTileStore xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/datasource/tile/geotiff" configVersion="3.4.0">

  <TileDataSet>
    <Identifier>test</Identifier>
    <TileMatrixSetId>utah</TileMatrixSetId>
    <File>../../data/test.tif</File>
    <ImageFormat>image/png</ImageFormat>
  </TileDataSet>
...
</GeoTIFFTileStore>
----

(You can define multiple tile data sets within one tile store.)

* The identifier is optional, and defaults to the base name of the file
(in this example test.tif)
* The tile matrix set id references the tile matrix set
* obviously you need to point to the GeoTIFF file
* The image format specifies the _output_ image format, this is relevant
if you use the tile store for a WMTS. The default is image/png.

To generate a tile matrix set from the GeoTIFF, put a file into the
datasources/tile/tilematrixset/ directory. See how it must look like:

[source,xml]
----
<GeoTIFFTileMatrixSet xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/datasource/tile/tilematrixset/geotiff" configVersion="3.4.0">
  <StorageCRS>EPSG:26912</StorageCRS>
  <File>../../../data/utah.tif</File>
</GeoTIFFTileMatrixSet>
----

The storage crs is optional if the file contains an appropriate GeoTIFF
tag, but can be used to override it.

=== File system tile store

The file system tile store can be used to provide tiles from
http://tilecache.org[tile cache] like directory hierarchies. This tile
store is read-write.

Let's explain the configuration using an example:

[source,xml]
----
<FileSystemTileStore xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/datasource/tile/filesystem" configVersion="3.4.0">

  <TileDataSet>
    <Identifier>layer1</Identifier>
    <TileMatrixSetId>inspirecrs84quad</TileMatrixSetId>
    <TileCacheDiskLayout>
      <LayerDirectory>../../data/tiles/layer1</LayerDirectory>
      <FileType>png</FileType>
    </TileCacheDiskLayout>
  </TileDataSet>
...
</FileSystemTileStore>
----

(You can define multiple tile data sets within one tile store.)

* The identifier is optional, default is the layer directory base name
* The tile matrix set id references the tile matrix set
* Currently only the tile cache disk layout is supported. Just point to
the layer directory and specify the file type of the images (png is
recommended, but most image formats are supported)

Please note that if you use external tools to seed the tile store, you
need to make sure the resulting structure is compatible. The _00_
directory corresponds to the _first_ tile matrix of the referenced tile
matrix set, _01_ to the second tile matrix and so on.

=== Remote WMS tile store

The remote WMS tile store can be used to generate tiles on-the-fly from
a WMS service. This tile store is read-only.

While you can configure multiple tile data sets in one remote WMS tile
store configuration, they will all be based on one WMS.

Let's have a look at an example:

[source,xml]
----
<RemoteWMSTileStore xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/datasource/tile/remotewms" configVersion="3.4.0">

  <RemoteWMSId>wms1</RemoteWMSId>

  <TileDataSet>
    <Identifier>satellite</Identifier>
    <TileMatrixSetId>inspirecrs84quad</TileMatrixSetId>
    <OutputFormat>image/png</OutputFormat>
    <RequestParams>
      <Layers>SatelliteProvo</Layers>
      <Styles>default</Styles>
      <Format>image/png</Format>
      <CRS>EPSG:4326</CRS>
    </RequestParams>
  </TileDataSet>
...
</RemoteWMSTileStore>
----

* The remote wms id is mandatory, and must point to a WMS type remote
ows resource
* The identifier for the tile data sets is mandatory
* The tile matrix set id references the tile matrix set
* The output format is relevant if you use this tile data set in a WMTS

* The request params section specifies parameters to be used in the
GetMap requests sent to the WMS:::
  * The layers parameter can be used to specify one or more (comma
  separated) layers to request
  * The styles parameter must correspond to the layers parameter (works
  the same like GetMap)
  * The format parameter specifies the image format to request from the
  WMS
  * The CRS parameter specifies which CRS to use when requesting

Additionally you can specify default and override values for request
parameters within the request params block. Just add _Parameter_ tags
as described in the <<anchor-configuration-layer-request-options>> layer
chapter. The replacing/defaulting currently only works when you
configure a WMTS on top of this tile store. _GetTile_ parameters are
then mapped to _GetMap_ requests to the backend, and
_GetFeatureInfo_ WMTS parameters to _GetFeatureInfo_ WMS parameters
on the backend.

=== Remote WMTS tile store

The remote WMTS tile store can be used to generate tiles on-the-fly from
a WMTS service. This tile store is read-only.

While you can configure multiple tile data sets in one remote WMTS tile
store configuration, they will all be based on one WMTS.

Let's have a look at an example:

[source,xml]
----
<RemoteWMTSTileStore xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/datasource/tile/remotewmts" configVersion="3.4.0">

  <RemoteWMTSId>wmts1</RemoteWMTSId>

  <TileDataSet>
    <Identifier>satellite</Identifier>
    <OutputFormat>image/png</OutputFormat>
    <TileMatrixSetId>EPSG:4326</TileMatrixSetId>
    <RequestParams>
      <Layer>SatelliteProvo</Layer>
      <Style>default</Style>
      <Format>image/png</Format>
      <TileMatrixSet>EPSG:4326</TileMatrixSet>
    </RequestParams>
  </TileDataSet>

</RemoteWMTSTileStore>
----

* The remote WMTS id is mandatory, and must point to a WMTS type remote
OWS resource
* The identifier for the tile data sets is optional, defaults to the
value of the Layer request parameter
* The output format is relevant if you want to use this tile data set in
a WMTS, defaults to the value of the Format request parameter
* The tile matrix set id references the local tile matrix set you want
to use, defaults to the value of the TileMatrixSet request parameter

* The request params section specifies parameters to be used in the
GetTile requests sent to the WMTS:::
  * The layer parameter specifies the layer name to request
  * The style parameter specifies the style name to request
  * The format parameter specifies the image format to request
  * The tile matrix set parameter specifies the tile matrix set to
  request

Please note that you need a locally configured tile matrix set that
corresponds exactly to the tile matrix set of the remote WMTS. They need
not have the same identifier(s) (just configure the TileMatrixSetId
option if they differ), but the structure (coordinate system, tile size,
number of tiles per matrix etc.) needs to be identical.

Additionally you can specify default and override values for request
parameters within the request params block. Just add _Parameter_ tags
as described in the <<anchor-configuration-layer-request-options>> layer
chapter. The replacing/defaulting currently only works when you
configure a WMTS on top of this tile store. Please note that the
_scope_ attribute allows _GetTile_ and _GetFeatureInfo_, as
_GetMap_ is not supported by WMTS services.
