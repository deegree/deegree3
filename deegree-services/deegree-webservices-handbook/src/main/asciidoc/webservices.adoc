== Web services

This chapter describes the configuration of web service resources. You
can access this configuration level by clicking the *web services* link
in the administration console. The corresponding configuration files are
located in the _services/_ subdirectory of the active deegree
workspace directory.

.Web services are the top-level resources of the deegree workspace
image::workspace-overview-services.png[Web services are the top-level resources of the deegree workspace,scaledwidth=80.0%]

TIP: The identifier of a web service resource has a special purpose. If your
deegree instance can be reached at
_http://localhost:8080/deegree-webservices_, the common endpoint for
connecting to your services is
_http://localhost:8080/deegree-webservices/services_. However, if you
define multiple service resources of the same type in your workspace
(e.g. two WMS instances with identifiers _wms1_ and _wms2_), you
cannot use the common URL, as deegree cannot determine the targeted WMS
instance from the request. In this case, simply append the resource
identifier to the common endpoint URL (e.g.
_http://localhost:8080/deegree-webservices/services/wms2_) to choose
the service resource that you want to connect to explicitly.

=== Web Feature Service (WFS)

A deegree WFS setup consists of a WFS configuration file and any number
of feature store configuration files. Feature stores provide access to
the actual data (which may be stored in any of the supported backends,
e.g. in shapefiles or spatial databases such as PostGIS or Oracle
Spatial). In transactional mode (WFS-T), feature stores are also used
for modification of stored features:

.A WFS resource is connected to any number of feature store resources
image::workspace-wfs.png[A WFS resource is connected to any number of feature store resources,scaledwidth=80.0%]

==== Minimal example

The only mandatory option is _QueryCRS_, therefore, a minimal WFS
configuration example looks like this:

*WFS config example 1: Minimal configuration*

[source,xml]
----
<deegreeWFS configVersion="3.4.0"
  xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/services/wfs"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.deegree.org/services/wfs
  http://schemas.deegree.org/services/wfs/3.4.0/wfs_configuration.xsd">

  <QueryCRS>urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4258</QueryCRS>

</deegreeWFS>
----

This will create a deegree WFS with the feature types from all
configured feature stores in the workspace and
_urn:ogc:def:crs:EPSG::4258_ as coordinate system for returned GML
geometries.

==== Configuration overview

The deegree WFS config file format is defined by schema file
http://schemas.deegree.org/services/wfs/3.4.0/wfs_configuration.xsd. The
root element is <deegreeWFS> and the config attribute must be
_3.4.0_. The following table lists all available configuration options
(complex ones contain nested options themselves). When specifiying them,
their order must be respected.

[width="100%",cols="24%,11%,8%,57%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|SupportedVersions |0..1 |Complex |Activated OGC protocol versions,
default: all

|FeatureStoreId |0..n |String |Feature stores to attach, default: all

|EnableTransactions |0..1 |Complex |Enable transactions (WFS-T
operations), default: false

|EnableResponseBuffering |0..1 |Boolean |Enable response buffering

|DisabledResources |0..1 |Complex |Disables resolve of xlink:href
attribute references

|EnableResponsePaging |0..1 |Boolean |Enable response paging (WFS 2.0.0
option), default: false

|SupportedRequests |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of WFS requests

|QueryCRS |1..n |String |Announced CRS, first element is the default CRS

|QueryMaxFeatures |0..1 |Integer |Limit of features returned in a
response, default: 15000

|ExtendedCapabilities |0..n |String |Extended Metadata reported in
GetCapabilities response

|GMLFormat |0..n |Complex |GML format configuration

|CustomFormat |0..n |Complex |Custom format configuration
|===

The remainining sections describe these options and their sub-options in
detail.

==== General options

* _SupportedVersions_: By default, all implemented WFS protocol
versions (1.0.0, 1.1.0 and 2.0.0) will be activated. You can control
offered WFS protocol versions using element _SupportedVersions_. This
element allows any combination of the child elements
_<Version>1.0.0</Version>_, _<Version>1.1.0</Version>_ and
_<Version>2.0.0</Version>_.
* _FeatureStoreId_: By default, all feature stores in your deegree
workspace will be used for serving feature types. In some cases, this
may not be what you want, e.g. because you have two different WFS
instances running, or you don't want all feature types used in your WMS
for rendering to be available via your WFS. Use the _FeatureStoreId_
option to explicitly set the feature stores that this WFS should use.
* _EnableResponseBuffering_: By default, WFS responses are directly
streamed to the client. This is very much recommended and even a
requirement for transferring large responses efficiently. The only
drawback happens if exceptions occur, after a partial response has
already been transferred. In this case, the client will receive part
payload and part exception report. By specifying _false_ here, you can
explicitly force buffering of the full response, before it is written to
the client. Only if the full response could be generated successfully,
it will be transferred. If an exception happens at any time the buffer
will be discarded, and an exception report will be sent to the client.
Buffering is performed in memory, but switches to a temp file in case
the buffer grows bigger than 1 MiB.
* _DisabledResources_: By default all xlink:href attribute references
are tried to resolved as feature references during insert. This can be
avoided by configuring one or multiple base url patterns within the
child element _Pattern_. _Pattern_ can occur multiple times, one for
each base url. In the complex example above resolving of
_http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/DesignationSchemeValue/natura2000_
and
_http://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/Natura2000DesignationValue/specialProtectionArea_
is disabled, but not
_https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/codelist/DesignationSchemeValue/natura2000_
and _http://deegree.org/external/feature_.
* _EnableResponsePaging_: By default, WFS 2.0.0 does not support
response paging. By specifying _true_ here, you can explicitly enable
response paging. Response Paging works only when streaming is disabled.
Currently @next and @previous URLs bases on the original GetFeature
request in KVP encoding.
* _QueryCRS_: Coordinate reference systems for returned geometries.
This element can be specified multiple times, and the WFS will announce
all CRS in the GetCapabilities response (except for WFS 1.0.0 which does
not officially support using multiple coordinate reference systems). The
first element always specifies the default CRS (used when no CRS
parameter is present in a request).
* _QueryMaxFeatures_: By default, a maximum number of 15000 features
will be returned for a single _GetFeature_ request. Use this option to
override this setting. A value of _-1_ means unlimited.
* ''ResolveTimeOutInSeconds'': Use this option to specify a default
value for ResolveTimeOut, used in _GetFeature_ request if the
ResolveTimeOut option is not set.
* _QueryCheckAreaOfUse_: By default, spatial query constraints are not
checked with regard to the area of validity of the CRS. Set this option
to _true_ to enforce this check.

==== Transactions

By default, WFS-T requests will be rejected. Setting the
_EnableTransactions_ option to _true_ will enable transaction
support. This option has the optional attribute _idGenMode_ which
controls how ids of inserted features (the values in the gml:id
attribute) are treated. There are three id generation modes available:

* *UseExisting*: The original gml:id values from the input are stored.
This may lead to errors if the provided ids are already in use.
* *UseExistingResolvingReferencesInternally*: Same as UseExisting, but
it is allowed to insert features with references to already inserted
features.
* *GenerateNew* (default): New and unique ids are generated. References
in the input GML (xlink:href) that point to a feature with an reassigned
id are fixed as well, so reference consistency is maintained.
* *ReplaceDuplicate*: The WFS will try to use the original gml:id values
that have been provided in the input. In case a certain identifier
already exists in the backend, a new and unique identifier will be
generated. References in the input GML (xlink:href) that point to a
feature with an reassigned id are fixed as well, so reference
consistency is maintained.

NOTE: Currently, transactions can only be enabled if your WFS is attached to a
single feature store.

NOTE: Not every feature store implementation supports transactions, so you may
encounter that transactions are rejected, even though you activated them
in the WFS configuration.

NOTE: The details of the id generation depend on the feature store
implementation/configuration.

NOTE: In a WFS 1.1.0 insert, the id generation mode can be overridden by
attribute _idGenMode_ of the _Insert_ element. WFS 1.0.0 and WFS 2.0.0
don't support to specify the id generation mode on a request basis.

NOTE: When a feature is replaced the _UseExisting_ option is always
activated for that transaction. The gml:id of the feature is used for
the new version of the feature. The filter is used to identify the
feature to be replaced.

==== SupportedRequests

This option can be used to configure the supported request types.
Currently the supported encodings can be specified for each request
type. If the option is missing all encodings are supported for each
request type. The option has the following sup-options:

[width="100%",cols="14%,7%,5%,74%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|SupportedEncodings |0..1 |String |Enable encodings for all configured
request types. Allowed values: 'kvp', 'xml', 'soap'. Multiple values
must be separated by a white space.

|GetCapabilities |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of GetCapabilities
requests

|DescribeFeatureType |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of
DescribeFeatureType requests

|GetFeature |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of GetFeature requests

|Transaction |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of Transaction requests

|GetFeatureWithLock |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of GetFeatureWithLock
requests

|GetGmlObject |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of GetGmlObject requests

|LockFeature |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of LockFeature requests

|GetPropertyValue |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of GetPropertyValue
requests

|CreateStoredQuery |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of CreateStoredQuery
requests

|DropStoredQuery |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of DropStoredQuery
requests

|ListStoredQueries |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of ListStoredQueries
requests

|DescribeStoredQueries |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of
DescribeStoredQueries requests
|===

Each request type has the following sup-option:

[width="100%",cols="14%,8%,5%,73%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|SupportedEncodings |0..1 |String |Enable encodings for this request
types. Allowed values: 'kvp', 'xml', 'soap'. Multiple values must be
separated by a white space.
|===

By default deegree will provide all supported request types with all
available encodings (kvp, xml, soap).

If a single supported request or encoding is configured, all non
configured requests or encodings are disabled.

Example: To limit the provided request types to GetCapabilities and
GetFeature this request types can be added without SupportedEncodings
sub-option:

[source,xml]
----
<SupportedRequests>
  <GetCapabilities />
  <GetFeature />
</SupportedRequests>
----

Example: To disable SOAP encoding the other encodings can be added
without SupportedRequests sub-option:

[source,xml]
----
<SupportedRequests>
  <SupportedEncodings>kvp xml</SupportedEncodings>
</SupportedRequests>
----

WARNING: It is not checked if the configuration is valid against the WFS
specification!

==== Adapting GML output formats

By default, a deegree WFS will offer GML 2, 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 as output
formats and announce those formats in the GetCapabilities responses
(except for WFS 1.0.0, as this version of the standard has no means of
announcing other formats than GML 2). The element for GetFeature
responses is _wfs:FeatureCollection_, as mandated by the WFS
specification.

In some cases, you may want to alter aspects of the offered output
formats. For example, if you want your WFS to serve a specific
application schema (e.g. INSPIRE Data Themes), you should restrict the
announced GML versions to the one used for the application schema. These
and other output-format related aspects can be controlled by element
_GMLFormat_.

*Example for WFS config option _GMLFormat_*

The _GMLFormat_ option has the following sub-options:

[width="100%",cols="24%,11%,7%,58%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|@gmlVersion |1..1 |String |GML version (GML_2, GML_30, GML_31 or

responses

|DecimalCoordinateFormatter/ CustomCoordinateFormatter |0..1 |Complex
|Controls the formatting of geometry coordinates

|GeometryLinearization |0..1 |Complex |Activates/controls the
linearization of exported geometries
|===

===== Basic GML format options

* _@gmlVersion_: This attribute defines the GML version (GML_2,
GML_30, GML_31 or GML_32)
* _MimeType_: Mime types associated with this format configuration
(and announced in GetCapabilities)
* _GenerateBoundedByForFeatures_: By default, the _gml:boundedBy_
property will only be exported for the member features if the feature
store provides it. By setting this option to _true_, the WFS will
calculate the envelope and include it as a _gml:boundedBy_ property.
Please note that this setting does not affect the inclusion of the
_gml:boundedBy_ property for on the feature collection level (see
DisableStreaming for that).

===== GetFeature response settings

Option _GetFeatureResponse_ has the following sub-options:

[width="100%",cols="21%,11%,9%,59%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|ContainerElement |0..1 |QName |Qualified root element name, default:
wfs:FeatureCollection

|FeatureMemberElement |0..1 |QName |Qualified feature member element
name, default: gml:featureMember

|AdditionalSchemaLocation |0..1 |String |Added to xsi:schemaLocation
attribute of wfs:FeatureCollection

|DisableDynamicSchema |0..1 |Complex |Controls DescribeFeatureType
strategy, default: regenerate schema

|DisableStreaming |0..1 |Boolean |Disables output streaming, include
numberOfFeature information/gml:boundedBy

|PrebindNamespace |0..n |Complex |Pre-bind namespaces in the root
element
|===

* _ContainerElement_: By default, the container element of a
GetFeature response is _wfs:FeatureCollection_. Using this option, you
can specify an alternative element name. In order to bind the namespace
prefix, use standard XML namespace mechanisms (xmlns attribute). This
option is ignored for WFS 2.0.0.
* _FeatureMemberElement_: By default, the member features are included
in _gml:featureMember_ (WFS 1.0.0/1.1.0) or _wfs:member_ elements
(WFS 2.0.0). Using this option, you can specify an alternative element
name. In order to bind the namespace prefix, use standard XML namespace
mechanisms (xmlns attribute). This option is ignored for WFS 2.0.0.
* _AdditionalSchemaLocation_: By default, the _xsi:schemaLocation_
attribute in a GetFeature response is auto-generated and refers to all
schemas necessary for validation of the response. Using this option, you
can add additional namespace/URL pairs for adding additional schemas.
This may be required when you override the returned container or feature
member elements in order to achieve schema-valid output.
* _DisableDynamicSchema_: By default, the GML application schema
returned in DescribeFeatureType reponses (and referenced in the
_xsi:schemaLocation_ of query responses) will be generated dynamically
from the internal feature type representation. This allows generation of
application schemas for different GML versions and is fine for simple
feature models (e.g. feature types served from shapefiles or flat
database tables). However, valid re-encoding of complex GML application
schema (such as INSPIRE Data Themes) is technically not feasible. In
these cases, you will have to set this option to _false_, so the WFS
will produce a response that refers to the original schema files used
for configuring the feature store. If you want the references to point
to an external copy of your GML application schema files (instead of
pointing back to the deegree WFS), use the optional attribute
_baseURL_ that this element provides.
* _DisableStreaming_: By default, returned features are not collected
in memory, but directly streamed from the backend (e.g. an SQL database)
and individually encoded as GML. This enables the querying of huge
numbers of features with only minimal memory footprint. However, by
using this strategy, the number of features and their bounding box is
not known when the WFS starts to write out the response. Therefore, this
information is omitted from the response (which is perfectly valid
according to WFS 1.0.0 and 1.1.0, and a change request for WFS 2.0.0 has
been accepted). If you find that your WFS client has problems with the
response, you may set this option to _false_. Features will be
collected in memory first and the generated response will include
numberOfFeature information and gml:boundedBy for the collection.
However, for huge response and heavy server load, this is not
recommended as it introduces significant overhead and may result in
out-of-memory errors.

* _PrebindNamespace_: By default, XML namespaces are bound when they
are needed. This will result in valid output, but may lead to the same
namespace being bound again and again in different parts of the response
document. Using this option, namespaces can be bound in the root
element, so they are defined for the full scope of the response document
and do not need re-definition at several positions in the document. This
option has the required attributes _prefix_ and _uri_. .. note::
PrebindNamespaces must be configured as in used GML application schemas
respectively the imported features (at least for the BLOB mode). It is
essential to ensure that prefixes are bound to the same namespace URIs.
Otherwise, a GetFeature request may result in a failure ("Duplicate
declaration for namespace prefix").

===== Coordinate formatters

By default, GML geometries will be encoded using 6 decimal places for
CRS with degree axes and 3 places for CRS with metric axes. In order to
override this, two options are available:

* _DecimalCoordinatesFormatter_: Empty element, attribute _places_
specifies the number of decimal places.
* _CustomCoordinateFormatter_: By specifiying this element, an
implementation of Java interface
_org.deegree.geometry.io.CoordinateFormatter_ can be instantiated.
Child element _JavaClass_ contains the qualified name of the Java
class (which must be on the classpath).

===== Geometry linearization

Some feature stores (e.g. the SQL feature store when connected to an
Oracle Spatial database) can deliver non-linear geometries (e.g. arcs).
Here's an example for the GML 3.1.1 encoding of such a geometry as it
would be returned by the WFS:

*Example for a non-linear GML geometry*

      </gml:curveMember>
    </gml:Ring>
  </gml:exterior>
</gml:Polygon>
...
----

This is perfectly valid GML, but there are two reasons why you may not
want your WFS to return non-linear GML geometries:

* There's no encoding for non-linear GML geometries in GML version 2
* Currently available WFS clients (e.g. QGIS, uDig, ...) cannot cope
with them

Option _GeometryLinearization_ will ensure that GML responses will
only contain linear geometries. Curves with non-linear segments and
surfaces with non-linear boundary segments will be converted before they
are encoded to GML. Here's an example usage of this GML format option:

*Example config snippet for activating geometry linearization*

[source,xml]
----
...
<GeometryLinearization>
  <Accuracy>0.1</Accuracy>
</GeometryLinearization>
...
----

_GeometryLinearization_ has a single mandatory option _Accuracy_. It
defines the numerical accuracy of the linear approximation in units of
the coordinate reference system used by the feature store. If the
coordinate reference system is based on meters, a value of 0.1 will
ensure that the maximum error between the original and the linearized
geometry does not exceed 10 centimeters.

Here's an example of a linearized version of the example geometry as it
would be generated by the WFS:

==== Adding custom output formats

Using option element _CustomFormat_, it is possible to plug-in your
own Java classes to generate the output for a specific mime type (e.g. a
binary format)

==== Stored queries

Besides standard ('ad hoc') queries, WFS 2.0.0 introduces so-called
stored queries. When WFS 2.0.0 support is activated, your WFS will
automatically support the well-known stored query
_urn:ogc:def:storedQuery:OGC-WFS::GetFeatureById_ (defined in the WFS
2.0.0 specification). It can be used to query a feature instance by
specifying it's gml:id (similar to GetGmlObject requests in WFS 1.1.0).
In order to define custom stored queries, use the _StoredQuery_
element to specify the file name of a StoredQueryDefinition file. The
given file name (can be relative) must point to a valid WFS 2.0.0
StoredQueryDefinition file. Here's an example:

*Example for a WFS 2.0.0 StoredQueryDefinition file*

[source,xml]
----
<StoredQueryDefinition id="urn:x-inspire:query:GetAddressesForStreet"
  xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/wfs/2.0"
  xmlns:ad="urn:x-inspire:specification:gmlas:Addresses:3.0"
  xmlns:gn="urn:x-inspire:specification:gmlas:GeographicalNames:3.0">
  <Title>GetAddressesForStreet</Title>
  <Abstract>Returns the ad:Address features located in the specified street.</Abstract>
  <Parameter name="streetName" type="xs:string">
    <Abstract>Name of the street (mandatory)</Abstract>
  </Parameter>
  <QueryExpressionText returnFeatureTypes="ad:Address"
   language="urn:ogc:def:queryLanguage:OGC-:WFSQueryExpression">
    <Query typeNames="ad:Address">
      <Filter xmlns="http://www.opengis.net/fes/2.0">
        <PropertyIsEqualTo>
          <ValueReference>
ad:component/ad:ThoroughfareName/ad:name/gn:GeographicalName/gn:spelling/gn:SpellingOfName/gn:text
          </ValueReference>
          <Literal>${streetName}</Literal>
        </PropertyIsEqualTo>
      </Filter>
    </Query>
  </QueryExpressionText>
</StoredQueryDefinition>
----

This example is actually usable if your WFS is set up to serve the
ad:Address feature type from INSPIRE Annex I. It defines the stored
query _urn:x-inspire:storedQuery:GetAddressesForStreet_ for retrieving
ad:Address features that are located in the specified street. The street
name is passed using parameter _streetName_. If your WFS instance can
be reached at _http://localhost:8080/services_, you could use the
request
_http://localhost:8080/services?request=GetFeature&storedquery_id=urn:x-inspire:storedQuery:GetAddressesForStreet&streetName=Madame%20Curiestraat_
to fetch the ad:Address features in street Madame Curiestraat.

The attribute returnFeatureTypes of QueryExpressionText can be left
empty. If this is the case, the element will be filled with all feature
types served by the WFS when executing a DescribeStoredQueries request.
The same applies for the value $\{deegreewfs:ServedFeatureTypes}. If a
value is set for returnFeatureTypes, the user is responsible to
configure it as expected: Usually values of the typeNames of the
Query-Elements should be used. An exception is thrown as
DescribeStoredQueries response, if the configured feature type is not
served by the WFS.

TIP: deegree WFS supports the execution of stored queries using
_GetFeature_ and _GetPropertyValue_ requests. It also implements the
_ListStoredQueries_ and the _DescribeStoredQueries_ operations.
However, there is no support for _CreateStoredQuery_ and
_DropStoredQuery_ at the moment.

==== Extended capabilities

Important for applications like INSPIRE, it is often desirable to
include predefined blocks of XML in the extended capabilities section of
the WFS capabilities output. This can be achieved simply by adding these
blocks to the extended capabilities element of the configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<ExtendedCapabilities>
  <MyCustomOutput xmlns="http://www.custom.org/output">
    ...
  </MyCustomOutput>
</ExtendedCapabilities>
----

You must set the attribute _wfsVersions_ to indicate the version that
you want to define the extended capabilities for. If your service
supports multiple protocol versions (e.g. a WFS that supports 1.1.0 and
2.0.0), you may include multiple _ExtendedCapabilities_ elements in
the metadata configuration.

WARNING: The extended capabilities set in the WFS service configuration are
ignored, if a metadata configuration file (see chapter
<<anchor-configuration-service-metadata>>) exists. Instead, the extended
capabilities must be configured there.

[[anchor-configuration-wms]]
=== Web Map Service (WMS)

In deegree terminology, a deegree WMS renders maps from data stored in
feature, coverage and tile stores. The WMS is configured using a layer
structure, called a _theme_. A theme can be thought of as a collection
of layers, organized in a tree structure. _What_ the layers show is
configured in a layer configuration, and _how_ it is shown is configured
in a style file. Supported style languages are StyledLayerDescriptor
(SLD) and Symbology Encoding (SE).

.A WMS resource is connected to exactly one theme resource
image::workspace-wms.png[A WMS resource is connected to exactly one theme resource,scaledwidth=80.0%]

TIP: In order to fully understand deegree WMS configuration, you will have to
learn configuration of other workspace aspects as well. Chapter
<<anchor-configuration-renderstyles>> describes the creation of layers
and styling rules. Chapter <<anchor-configuration-featurestore>>
describes the configuration of vector data access and chapter
<<anchor-configuration-coveragestore>> describes the configuration of
raster data access.

==== A word on layers and themes

Readers familiar with the WMS protocol might be wondering why layers can
not be configured directly in the WMS configuration file. Inspired by
WMTS 1.0.0 we found the idea to separate structure and content very
appealing. Thinking of a layer store that just offers a set of layers is
an easy concept. Thinking of a theme as a structure that may contain
layers at certain points also makes sense. But when thinking of WMS the
terms begin clashing. We suggest to avoid confusion as much as possible
by using the same name for each corresponding theme, layer and possibly
even tile/feature/coverage data sources. We believe that once you work a
little with the concept of themes, and seeing them exported as WMS layer
trees, the concepts fit well enough so you can appreciate the clean cut.

==== Configuration overview

The configuration can be split up in six sections. Readers familiar with
other deegree service configurations may recognize some similarities,
but we'll describe the options anyway, because there may be subtle
differences. A document template looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version='1.0'?>
<deegreeWMS xmlns='http://www.deegree.org/services/wms'>
  <!-- actual configuration goes here -->
</deegreeWMS>
----

The following table shows what top level options are available.

[width="100%",cols="22%,11%,7%,60%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|SupportedVersions |0..1 |Complex |Limits active OGC protocol versions

|SupportedRequests |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of WMS requests

|UpdateSequence |0..1 |Integer |Current update sequence, default: 0

|MetadataStoreId |0..1 |String |Configures a metadata store to check if
metadata ids for layers exist

|MetadataURLTemplate |0..1 |String |Template for generating URLs to
feature type metadata

|ServiceConfiguration |1 |Complex |Configures service content

|GetCapabilitiesFormats |0..1 |Complex |Configures additional
capabilities output formats

|FeatureInfoFormats |0..1 |Complex |Configures additional feature info
output formats

|GetMapFormats |0..1 |Complex |Configures additional image output
formats

|ExceptionFormats |0..1 |Complex |Configures additional exception output
formats

|ExtendedCapabilities |0..n |Complex |Extended Metadata reported in
GetCapabilities response

|LayerLimit |0..1 |Integer |Maximum number of layers in a GetMap
request, default: unlimited

|MaxWidth |0..1 |Integer |Maximum width in a GetMap request, default:
unlimited

|MaxHeight |0..1 |Integer |Maximum height in a GetMap request, default:
unlimited
|===

==== Basic options

* _SupportedVersions_: By default, all implemented WMS protocol
versions (1.1.1 and 1.3.0) are activated. You can control offered WMS
protocol versions using the element _SupportedVersions_. This element
allows any of the child elements _<Version>1.1.1</Version>_ and
_<Version>1.3.0</Version>_.
* _MetadataStoreId_: If set to a valid metadata store, the store is
queried upon startup with all configured layer metadata set ids. If a
metadata set does not exist in the metadata store, it will not be
exported as metadata URL in the capabilties. This is a useful option if
you want to automatically check for configuration errors/typos. By
default, no checking is done.
* _MetadataURLTemplate_: By default, no metadata URLs are generated
for layers in the capabilities. You can set this option either to a
unique URL, which will be exported as is, or to a template with a
placeholder. In any case, a metadata URL will only be exported if the
layer has a metadata set id set. A template looks like this:
http://discovery.eu/csw?service=CSW&request=GetRecordById&version=2.0.2&id=$%7BmetadataSetId%7D&outputSchema=http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmd&elementSetName=full.
Please note that you'll need to escape the & symbols with &amp; as shown
in the example. The $\{metadataSetId} will be replaced with the metadata
set id from each layer.

Here is a snippet for quick copy & paste:

[source,xml]
----
<SupportedVersions>
  <SupportedVersion>1.1.1</SupportedVersion>
</SupportedVersions>
<MetadataStoreId>mdstore</MetadataStoreId>
<MetadataURLTemplate>http://discovery.eu/csw?service=CSW&amp;request=GetRecordById&amp;version=2.0.2&amp;id=${metadataSetId}&amp;outputSchema=http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmd&amp;elementSetName=full</MetadataURLTemplate>
----

[[anchor-wms-supportedrequests]]
==== SupportedRequests

This option can be used to configure the supported request types.
Currently, the supported encodings can be specified for each request
type. If the option is missing, all encodings are supported for each
request type. The option has the following sup-options:

[width="100%",cols="14%,7%,5%,74%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|SupportedEncodings |0..1 |String |Enable encodings for all configured
request types. Allowed values: 'kvp', 'xml', 'soap'. Multiple values
must be separated by a white space.

|GetCapabilities |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of GetCapabilities
requests

|GetMap |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of GetMap requests

|GetFeatureInfo |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of GetFeatureInfo requests

|DescribeLayer |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of DescribeLayer requests

|GetLegendGraphic |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of GetLegendGraphic
requests

|GetFeatureInfoSchema |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of
GetFeatureInfoSchema requests

|DTD |0..1 |Complex |Configuration of DTD requests
|===

Each request type has the following sup-option:

[width="100%",cols="14%,8%,5%,73%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|SupportedEncodings |0..1 |String |Enable encodings for this request
types. Allowed values: 'kvp', 'xml', 'soap'. Multiple values must be
separated by a white space.
|===

By default deegree will provide all supported request types with all
available encodings (kvp, xml, soap).

If a single supported request or encoding is configured, all non
configured requests or encodings are disabled.

Example: To limit the provided request types to GetCapabilities and
GetFeature this request types can be added without SupportedEncodings
sub-option:

[source,xml]
----
<SupportedRequests>
  <GetCapabilities />
  <GetFeature />
</SupportedRequests>
----

Example: To disable SOAP encoding the other encodings can be added
without SupportedRequests sub-option:


[source,xml]
----
<SupportedRequests>
  <SupportedEncodings>kvp xml</SupportedEncodings>
</SupportedRequests>
----

WARNING: It is not checked if the configuration is valid against the WMS
specification!

WARNING: WMS 1.1.1 just supports KVP. SOAP can only be used for GetCapabilities,
GetMap and GetFeatureInfo operations of WMS 1.3.0. Nevertheless,
configuration of all combinations is possible.

==== Service content configuration

You can configure the behaviour of layers using the
_DefaultLayerOptions_ element.

Have a look at the layer options and their values:

[width="100%",cols="12%,8%,5%,75%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |String |Description
|Antialiasing |0..1 |String |Whether to antialias NONE, TEXT, IMAGE or
BOTH, default is BOTH

|RenderingQuality |0..1 |String |Whether to render LOW, NORMAL or HIGH
quality, default is HIGH

|Interpolation |0..1 |String |Whether to use BILINEAR, NEARESTNEIGHBOUR
or BICUBIC interpolation, default is NEARESTNEIGHBOUR

|MaxFeatures |0..1 |Integer |Maximum number of features to render at
once, default is 10000

|FeatureInfoRadius |0..1 |Integer |Number of pixels to consider when
doing GetFeatureInfo, default is 1

|Opaque |0..1 |Boolean |Indicates if the map data of the layer are
mostly or completely opaque (true) or represents vector features that
probably do not completely fill space (false), default is false
|===

You can configure the WMS to use one or more preconfigured themes. In
WMS terms, each theme is mapped to a layer in the WMS capabilities. So
if you use one theme, the WMS root layer corresponds to the root theme.
If you use multiple themes, a synthetic root layer is exported in the
capabilities, with one child layer corresponding to each root theme. The
themes are configured using the _ThemeId_ element.

Here is an example snippet of the content section:

[source,xml]
----
<ServiceConfiguration>

  <DefaultLayerOptions>
    <Antialiasing>NONE</Antialiasing>
  </DefaultLayerOptions>

  <ThemeId>mytheme</ThemeId>

</ServiceConfiguration>
----

==== Custom capabilities formats

Any mime type can be configured to be available as response format for
GetCapabilities requests, although the most commonly used is probably
_text/html_. A XSLT script is used to generate the output.

This is how the configuration section looks like:

[source,xml]
----
<GetCapabilitiesFormats>
  <GetCapabilitiesFormat>
    <XSLTFile>capabilities2html.xsl</XSLTFile>
    <Format>text/html</Format>
  </GetCapabilitiesFormat>
</GetCapabilitiesFormats>
----

Of course it is possible to define as many custom formats as you want,
as long as you use a different mime type for each (just duplicate the
_GetCapabilitiesFormat_ element). If you use one of the default
formats, the default output will be overridden with your configuration.

[[anchor-featureinfo-configuration]]
==== Custom feature info formats

Any mime type can be configured to be available as response format for
GetFeatureInfo requests, although the most commonly used is probably
_text/html_. There are two alternative ways of controlling how the
output is generated (besides using the default HTML output). One
involves a deegree specific templating mechanism, the other involves
writing an XSLT script. The deegree specific mechanism has the advantage
of being considerably less verbose, making common use cases very easy,
while the XSLT approach gives you all the freedom.

This is how the configuration section looks like for configuring a
deegree templating based format:

[source,xml]
----
<FeatureInfoFormats>
  <GetFeatureInfoFormat>
    <File>../customformat.gfi</File>
    <Format>text/html</Format>
    <Property name="customname" value="customvalue" \>
  </GetFeatureInfoFormat>
</FeatureInfoFormats>
----

The configuration for the XSLT approach looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<FeatureInfoFormats>
  <GetFeatureInfoFormat>
    <XSLTFile gmlVersion="GML_32">../customformat.xsl</XSLTFile>
    <Format>text/html</Format>
    <Property name="customname" value="customvalue" \>
  </GetFeatureInfoFormat>
</FeatureInfoFormats>
----

Of course it is possible to define as many custom formats as you want,
as long as you use a different mime type for each (just duplicate the
_GetFeatureInfoFormat_ element). If you use one of the default
formats, the default output will be overridden with your configuration.

In order to write your XSLT script, you'll need to develop it against a
specific GML version (namespaces between GML versions may differ, GML
output itself will differ). The default is GML 3.2, you can override it
by specifying the _gmlVersion_ attribute on the _XSLTFile_ element.
Valid GML version strings are _GML_2_, _GML_30_, _GML_31_ and
_GML_32_.

If you want to learn more about the templating format, read the
following sections.

==== FeatureInfo templating format

The templating format can be used to create text based output formats
for featureinfo output. It uses a number of definitions, rules and
special constructs to replace content with other content based on
feature and property values. Please note that you should make sure your
file is UTF-8 encoded if you're using umlauts.

===== Introduction/Example

This section gives a quick overview how the format works and
demonstrates the development of a small sample HTML output.

On top level, you can have a number of _template definitions_. A
template always has a name, and there always needs to be a template
named _start_ (yes, it's the one we start with).

A simple valid templating file that does not actually depend on the
features coming in looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<?template start>
<html>
<body>
  <p>Hello</p>
</body>
</html>
----

A featureinfo request will now always yield the body of this template.
In order to use the features coming in, you need to define other
templates, and call them from a template. So let's add another template,
and call it from the _start_ template:

[source,xml]
----
<?template start>
<html>
<body>
<ul>
<?feature *:myfeaturetemplate>
</ul>
</body>
</html>

<?template myfeaturetemplate>
<li>I have a feature</li>
----

What happens now is that first the body of the _start_ template is
being output. In that output, the _<?feature *:myfeaturetemplate>_ is
replaced with the content of the _myfeaturetemplate_ template for each
feature in the feature collection. So if your query hits five features,
you'll get five _li_ tags like in the template. The asterisk is used
to select all features, it's possible to limit the number of objects
matched. See below in the reference section for a detailed explanation
on how it works.

Within the _myfeaturetemplate_ template you have switched context. In
the _start_ template your context is the feature collection, and you
can call _feature templates_. In the _myfeaturetemplate_ you 'went
down' the tree and are now in a feature context, where you can call
_property templates_. So what can we do in a feature context? Let's
start simple by writing out the feature type name. Change the
_myfeaturetemplate_ like this:

[source,xml]
----
<?template myfeaturetemplate>
<li>I have a <?name> feature</li>
----

What happens now is that for each use of the _myfeaturetemplate_ the
_<?name>_ part is being replaced with the name of the feature type of
the feature you hit. So if you hit two features, each of a different
type, you get two different _li_ tags in the document, each with its
name written in it.

So deegree only replaces the _template call_ in the _start_ template
with its replacement once the special constructs in the _called_
template are all replaced, and all the special constructs/calls within
_that_ template are all replaced, ... and so on.

Let's take it to the next level. What's you really want to do in
featureinfo responses is of course get the value of the features'
properties. So let's add another template, and call it from the
_myfeaturetemplate_ template:

[source,xml]
----
<?template myfeaturetemplate>
<li>I have a <?name> feature and properties: <?property *:mypropertytemplate></li>

<?template mypropertytemplate>
<?name>=<?value>
----

Now you also get all property names and values in the _li_ item. Note
that again you switched the context in the template, now you are at
property level. The _<?name>_ and _<?value>_ special constructs
yield the property name and value, respectively (remember, we're at
property level here).

While that's already nice, people often put non human readable values in
properties, even property names are sometimes not human readable. In
order to fix that, you often have code lists mapping the codes to proper
text. To use these, there's a special kind of template called a _map_. A
map is like a simple property file. Let's have a look at how to define
one:

[source,xml]
----
<?map mycodelistmap>
code1=Street
code2=Highway
code3=Railway

<?map mynamecodelistmap>
tp=Type of way
----

Looks simple enough. Instead of _template_ we use map, after that
comes the name. Then we just map codes to values. So how do we use this?
Instead of just using the _<?name>_ or _<?value>_ we push it through
the map:

[source,xml]
----
<?template mypropertytemplate>
<?name:map mynamecodelistmap>=<?value:map mycodelistmap>
----

Here the name of the property is replaced with values from the
_mynamecodelistmap_, the value is replaced with values from the
_mycodelistmap_. If the map does not contain a fitting mapping, the
original value is used instead.

That concludes the introduction, the next section explains all available
special constructs in detail.

===== Templating special constructs

This section shows all available special constructs. The selectors are
explained in the table below. The validity describes in which context
the construct can be used (and where the description applies). The
validity can be one of _top level_ (which means it's the definition of
something), _featurecollection_ (the _start_ template), _feature_ (a
template on feature level), _property_ (a template on property level) or
_map_ (a map definition).

[width="100%",cols="22%,13%,65%",options="header",]
|===
|Construct |Validity |Description
|<?template __name_>_ |top level |defines a template with name _name_

|<?map __name_>_ |top level |defines a map with name _name_

|<?feature _selector_:__name_>_ |featurecollection |calls the template
with name _name_ for features matching the selector _selector_

|<?property _selector_:__name_>_ |feature |calls the template with name
_name_ for properties matching the selector _selector_

|<?name> |feature |evaluates to the feature type name

|<?name> |property |evaluates to the property name

|<?name:map __name_>_ |feature |uses the map _name_ to map the feature
type name to a value

|<?name:map __name_>_ |property |uses the map _name_ to map the property
name to a value

|<?value> |property |evaluates to the property's value

|<?value:map __name_>_ |property |uses the map _name_ to map the
property's value to another value

|<?index> |feature |evaluates to the index of the feature (in the list
of matches from the previous template call)

|<?index> |property |evaluates to the index of the property (in the list
of matches from the previous template call)

|<?gmlid> |feature |evaluates to the feature's gml:id

|<?odd:__name_>_ |feature |calls the _name_ template if the index of the
current feature is odd

|<?odd:__name_>_ |property |calls the _name_ template if the index of
the current property is odd

|<?even:__name_>_ |feature |calls the _name_ template if the index of
the current feature is even

|<?even:__name_>_ |property |calls the _name_ template if the index of
the current property is even

|<?link:_prefix_:> |property |if the value of the property is not an
absolute link, the prefix is prepended

|<?link:_prefix_:__text_>_ |property |the text of the link will be
_text_ instead of the link address
|===

The selector for properties and features is a kind of pattern matching
on the object's name.

[width="100%",cols="32%,68%",options="header",]
|===
|Selector |Description
|* |matches all objects

|* _text_ |matches all objects with names ending in _text_

|_text_ * |matches all objects with names starting with _text_

|not(_selector_) |matches all objects not matching the selector
_selector_

|_selector1_, _selector2_ |matches all objects matching _selector1_ and
_selector2_
|===

[[anchor-image-output-configuration]]
==== Custom image output formats

Any mime type of the following output formats can be configured to be
available as response format for GetMap requests.

----
* _image/png_
* _image/png; subtype=8bit_
* _image/png; mode=8bit_
* _image/gif_
* _image/jpeg_
* _image/tiff_
* _image/x-ms-bmp_
----

If no format has been configured, all formats are supported.

This is how the configuration section looks like for configuring only
_image/png_ as image output format:

[source,xml]
----
<GetMapFormats>
  <GetMapFormat>image/png</GetMapFormat>
</GetMapFormats>
----

===== Custom format provider class

Using option element _CustomGetMapFormat_, it is possible to plug-in
your own Java classes to generate the output for a specific mime type

[width="100%",cols="15%,15%,10%,60%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|Format |1..1 |String |Mime type associated with this format
configuration

|JavaClass |1..1 |String |Qualified Java class name

|Property |0..n |Complex |Configure properties of the JavaClass
|===

* _Format_: Mime type associated with this format configuration (and
announced in GetCapabilities)
* _JavaClass_: Therefore, an implementation of interface
_org.deegree.rendering.r2d.ImageSerializer_ must be present on the
classpath.
* _Property_:

This is how the configuration looks like for the implementation of
GeoTIFF:

[source,xml]
----
<GetMapFormats>
  <CustomGetMapFormat>
    <Format>image/tiff</Format>
    <JavaClass>org.deegree.services.wms.controller.plugins.ImageSerializerGeoTiff</JavaClass>
  </CustomGetMapFormat>
</GetMapFormats>
----

==== Custom exception formats

Any mime type can be configured to be available as response format for
Exceptions, although the most commonly used is probably _text/html_. A
XSLT script is used to generate the output.

This is how the configuration section looks like:

[source,xml]
----
<ExceptionFormats>
  <ExceptionFormat>
    <XSLTFile>exception2html.xsl</XSLTFile>
    <Format>text/html</Format>
  </ExceptionFormat>
</ExceptionFormats>
----

Of course it is possible to define as many custom formats as you want,
as long as you use a different mime type for each (just duplicate the
_ExceptionFormat_ element). If you use one of the default formats, the
default output will be overridden with your configuration.

==== Extended capabilities

Important for applications like INSPIRE, it is often desirable to
include predefined blocks of XML in the extended capabilities section of
the WMS capabilities output. This can be achieved simply by adding these
blocks to the extended capabilities element of the configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<ExtendedCapabilities>
  <MyCustomOutput xmlns="http://www.custom.org/output">
    ...
  </MyCustomOutput>
</ExtendedCapabilities>
----

WARNING: The extended capabilities set in the WMS service configuration are
ignored, if a metadata configuration file (see chapter
<<anchor-configuration-service-metadata>>) exists. Instead, the extended
capabilities must be configured there.

WARNING: Extended Capabilities are currently not supported by WMS 1.1.1. In WMS 1.1.1 configured extended capabilities are ignored and not included in the capabilities document.

==== Vendor specific parameters

The deegree WMS supports a number of vendor specific parameters. Some
parameters are supported on a per layer basis while some are applied to
the whole request. Most of the parameters correspond to the layer
options above.

The parameters which are supported on a per layer basis can be used to
set an option globally, eg. ...&REQUEST=GetMap&ANTIALIAS=BOTH&..., or
for each layer separately (using a comma separated list):
...&REQUEST=GetMap&ANTIALIAS=BOTH,TEXT,NONE&LAYERS=layer1,layer2,layer3&...
Most of the layer options have a corresponding parameter with a similar
name: ANTIALIAS, INTERPOLATION, QUALITY and MAX_FEATURES. The feature
info radius can currently not be set dynamically.

The PIXELSIZE parameter can be used to dynamically adjust the resolution
of the resulting image. The default is the WMS default of 0.28 mm. So to
achieve a double resolution, you can double the WIDTH/HEIGHT parameter
values and set the PIXELSIZE parameter to 0.14.

Using the QUERYBOXSIZE parameter you can include features when rendering
that would normally not intersect the envelope specified in the BBOX
parameter. That can be useful if you have labels at point symbols out of
the envelope which would be rendered partly inside the map. Normal
GetMap behaviour will exclude such a label. With the QUERYBOXSIZE
parameter you can specify a factor by which to enlarge the original
bounding box, which is used solely for querying the data store (the
actual extent returned will not be changed!). Use values like 1.1 to
enlarge the envelope by 5% in each direction (this would be 10% in
total).

==== SOAP request encoding

The SOAP protocol can be used to request a WMS 1.3.0. SOAP 1.1 and 1.2
are supported.

A SOAP request is send via HTTP POST (without any KVP) and contains a
XML request body. The request body consists of a SOAP envelope and a XML
request body as described in chapter <<anchor-xml-request-encoding>>.

The operations GetCapabilities, GetMap and GetFeatureInfo support SOAP
request encoding.

*GetCapabilities SOAP request body example (can be used with Utah
example workspace)*

  </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
----

NOTE: SOAP encoding can be deactivated. Chapter
<<anchor-wms-supportedrequests>> describes and gives an example how to
disable it.

===== Capabilities

The support of the SOAP protocol by the WMS is described by an
ExtendedCapabilities element in namespace

[[anchor-configuration-wmts]]
=== Web Map Tile Service (WMTS)

In deegree terminology, a deegree WMTS provides access to tiles stored
in tile stores. The WMTS is configured using so-called _themes_. A theme
can be thought of as a collection of layers, organized in a tree
structure.

.A WMTS resource is connected to any number of theme resources (with tile layers)
image::workspace-wmts.png[A WMTS resource is connected to any number of theme resources (with tile layers),scaledwidth=80.0%]

TIP: In order to fully understand deegree WMTS configuration, you will have
to learn configuration of other workspace aspects as well. Chapter
<<anchor-configuration-tilestore>> describes the configuration of tile
data access. Chapter <<anchor-configuration-layers>> describes the
configuration of layers (only tile layers are usable for the WMTS).
Chapter <<anchor-configuration-themes>> describes how to create a theme
from layers.

==== Minimal example

The only mandatory section is _ServiceConfiguration_ (which can be
empty), therefore a minimal WMTS configuration example looks like this:

*WMTS config example 1: Minimal configuration*

[source,xml]
----
<deegreeWMTS configVersion="3.4.0"
  xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/services/wmts"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.deegree.org/services/wmts
  http://schemas.deegree.org/services/wmts/3.4.0/wmts.xsd">

  <ServiceConfiguration />

</deegreeWMTS>
----

This will create a deegree WMTS resource that connects to all configured
themes of the workspace.

==== More complex example

A more complex configuration that restricts the offered themes looks
like this:

*WMTS config example 2: More complex configuration*

[source,xml]
----
<deegreeWMTS configVersion="3.4.0"
  xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/services/wmts"

  <ServiceConfiguration>
    <ThemeId>water</ThemeId>
    <ThemeId>roads</ThemeId>
  </ServiceConfiguration>

</deegreeWMTS>
----

==== Configuration overview

The deegree WMTS config file format is defined by schema file
http://schemas.deegree.org/services/wmts/3.2.0/wmts.xsd. The root
element is _deegreeWMTS_ and the config attribute must be _3.2.0_.

The following table lists all available configuration options. When
specifying them, their order must be respected.

[width="100%",cols="22%,11%,7%,60%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|MetadataURLTemplate |0..1 |String |Template for generating URLs to
layer metadata

|ThemeId |0..n |String |Limits themes to use
|===

Below the _ServiceConfiguration_ section you can specify custom
featureinfo format handlers:

[source,xml]
----
...
</ServiceConfiguration>
<FeatureInfoFormats>
...
</FeatureInfoFormats>]
----

Have a look at section <<anchor-featureinfo-configuration>> (in the WMS
chapter) to see how custom featureinfo formats are configured. Take note
that the GetFeatureInfo operation is currently only supported for remote
WMS tile store backends.

[[anchor-configuration-csw]]
=== Catalogue Service for the Web (CSW)

In deegree terminology, a deegree CSW provides access to metadata
records stored in a metadata store. If the metadata store is
transaction-capable, CSW transactions can be used to modify the stored
records.

.A CSW resource is connected to exactly one metadata store resource
image::workspace-csw.png[A CSW resource is connected to exactly one metadata store resource,scaledwidth=80.0%]

TIP: In order to fully understand deegree CSW configuration, you will have to
learn configuration of other workspace aspects as well. Chapter
<<anchor-configuration-metadatastore>> describes the configuration of
metadatastores.

==== Minimal example

There is no mandatory element, therefore a minimal CSW configuration
example looks like this:

*CSW config example 1: Minimal configuration*

==== Configuration overview

The deegree CSW config file format is defined by schema file
http://schemas.deegree.org/services/csw/3.2.0/csw_configuration.xsd. The
root element is _deegreeCSW_ and the config attribute must be
_3.2.0_.

The following table lists all available configuration options. When
specifiying them, their order must be respected.

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,6%,64%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description

==== Extended Functionality

* deegree3 CSW supports JSON as additional output format. Use
_outputFormat="application/json"_ in your GetRecords or GetRecordById
Request to get the matching records in JSON.

[[anchor-configuration-wps]]
=== Web Processing Service (WPS)

A deegree WPS allows the invocation of geospatial processes. The offered
processes are determined by the attached process provider resources.

.Workspace components involved in a deegree WPS configuration
image::workspace-wps.png[Workspace components involved in a deegree WPS configuration,scaledwidth=90.0%]

TIP: In order to fully master deegree WPS configuration, you will have to
understand <<anchor-configuration-processproviders>> as well.

==== Minimal example

A minimal valid WPS configuration example looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<deegreeWPS configVersion="3.4.0" xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/services/wps" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.deegree.org/services/wps http://schemas.deegree.org/services/wps/3.1.0/wps_configuration.xsd">
</deegreeWPS>
----

This will create a WPS resource with the following properties:

* All WPS protocol versions are enabled. Currently, this is only 1.0.0.
* The WPS resource will attach to all process provider resources in the
workspace.
* Temporary files (e.g. for process results) are stored in the standard
Java temp directory of the deegree webapp.
* The last 100 process executions are tracked.
* Memory buffers (e.g. for inline XML inputs) are limited to 1 MB each.
If this limit is exceeded, buffering is switched to use a file in the
storage directory.

==== Complex example

A more complex configuration example looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<deegreeWPS configVersion="3.4.0" xmlns="http://www.deegree.org/services/wps" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.deegree.org/services/wps http://schemas.deegree.org/services/wps/3.1.0/wps_configuration.xsd">

  <SupportedVersions>
    <Version>1.0.0</Version>
  </SupportedVersions>

  <DefaultExecutionManager>
    <StorageDir>../var/wps/</StorageDir>
    <TrackedExecutions>1000</TrackedExecutions>
    <InputDiskSwitchLimit>1048576</InputDiskSwitchLimit>
  </DefaultExecutionManager>

</deegreeWPS>
----

This will create a WPS resource with the following properties:

* Enabled WPS protocol versions: 1.0.0
* The WPS resource will attach to all process provider resources in the
workspace.
* Storage directory for temporary files (e.g. for process results) is
_/var/wps_ inside the workspace.
* The last 1000 process executions will be tracked.
* Memory buffers (e.g. for inline XML inputs) are limited to 1 MB each.
If this limit is exceeded, buffering is switched to use a file in the
storage directory.

==== Configuration overview

The deegree WPS config file format is defined by schema file
http://schemas.deegree.org/services/wps/3.1.0/wps_configuration.xsd. The
root element is _deegreeWPS_ and the config attribute must be
_3.1.0_. The following table lists all available configuration options
(complex ones contain nested options themselves). When specifiying them,
their order must be respected.

[width="100%",cols="28%,14%,10%,48%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|SupportedVersions |0..1 |Complex |Activated OGC protocol versions,
default: all

|DefaultExecutionManager |0..1 |Complex |Settings for tracking process
executions
|===

The remainder of this section describes these options and their
sub-options in detail.

* _SupportedVersions_: By default, all implemented WMS protocol
versions are activated. Currently, this is just 1.0.0 anyway.
Alternatively you can control offered WPS protocol versions using the
element _SupportedVersions_. This element allows the child element
_<Version>1.0.0</Version>_ for now.

==== DefaultExecutionManager section

This section controls aspects that are related to temporary storage (for
input and output parameter values) during the execution of processes.
The _DefaultExecutionManager_ option has the following sub-options:

[width="100%",cols="20%,11%,7%,62%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|StorageDir |0..1 |String |Directory for storing execution-related data,
default: Java tempdir

|TrackedExecutions |0..1 |Integer |Number of executions to track,
default: 100

|InputDiskSwitchLimit |0..1 |Integer |Limit in bytes, before a
ComplexInputInput is written to disk, default: 1 MiB
|===

[[anchor-configuration-service-metadata]]
=== Metadata

This section describes the configuration for the different types of
metadata that a service reports in the _GetCapabilities_ response.
These options don't affect the data that the service offers or the
behaviour of the service. It merely changes the descriptive metadata
that the service reports.

In order to configure the metadata for a web service instance _xyz_,
create a corresponding _xyz_metadata.xml_ file in the _services_
directory of the workspace. The actual service type does not matter, the
configuration works for all types of service alike.

The metadata config file format is defined by schema file
http://schemas.deegree.org/services/metadata/3.2.0/metadata.xsd. The
root element is _deegreeServicesMetadata_ and the config attribute
must be _3.2.0_. The following table lists all available configuration
options (complex ones contain nested options themselves). When
specifiying them, their order must be respected.

[width="100%",cols="24%,11%,8%,57%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|ServiceIdentification |1..1 |Complex |Metadata that describes the
service

|ServiceProvider |1..1 |Complex |Metadata that describes the provider of
the service

|DatasetMetadata |0..1 |Complex |Metadata on the datasets provided by
the service

|ExtendedCapabilities |0..n |Complex |Extended Metadata reported in
OperationsMetadata section
|===

The remainder of this section describes these options and their
sub-options in detail.

WARNING: If a metadata configuration file exists, extended capabilities
configured in any service configuration (see chapters
<<anchor-configuration-wfs>> and <<anchor-configuration-wms>>) are
ignored. Instead, all extended capabilities must be configured in this
file.

==== Service identification

The _ServiceIdentification_ option has the following sub-options:

[width="100%",cols="20%,11%,7%,62%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|Title |0..n |String |Title of the service
|Abstract |0..n |String |Abstract
|Keywords |0..n |Complex |Keywords that describe the service
|Fees |0..1 |String |Fees that apply for using this service
|AccessConstraints |0..n |String |Access constraints for this service
|===

==== Service provider

The _ServiceProvider_ option has the following sub-options:

[width="100%",cols="23%,17%,12%,48%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|ProviderName |0..1 |String |Name of the service provider
|ProviderSite |0..1 |String |Website of the service provider
|ServiceContact |0..1 |Complex |Contact information
|===

==== Dataset metadata

This type of metadata is attached to the datasets that a service offers
(e.g. layers for the WMS or feature types for the WFS). The services
themselves may have specific mechanisms to override this metadata, so
make sure to have a look at the appropriate service sections. However,
some metadata configuration can be done right here.

To start with, you'll need to add a _DatasetMetadata_ container
element:

[source,xml]
----
<DatasetMetadata>
...
</DatasetMetadata>
----

Apart from the descriptive metadata (title, abstract etc.) for each
dataset, you can also configure _MetadataURL_s, external metadata
links and metadata as well as external metadata IDs.

For general _MetadataURL_ configuration, you can configure the element
_MetadataUrlTemplate_. Its content can be any URL, which may contain
the pattern _${metadataSetId}_. For each dataset (layer, feature type)
the service will output a _MetadataURL_ based on that pattern, if a
_MetadataSetId_ has been configured for that dataset (see below). The
template is optional, if omitted, no _MetadataURL_ will be produced.

Configuration for the template looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<DatasetMetadata>
  <MetadataUrlTemplate>http://some.url.de/csw?request=GetRecordById&amp;service=CSW&amp;version=2.0.2&amp;outputschema=http://www.isotc211.org/2005/gmd&amp;elementsetname=full&amp;id=${metadataSetId}</MetadataUrlTemplate>
...
</DatasetMetadata>
----

You can also configure _ExternalMetadataAuthority_ elements, which are
currently only used by the WMS. You can define multiple authorities,
with the authority URL as text content and a unique _name_ attribute.
For each dataset you can define an ID for an authority by refering to
that name. This will generate an _AuthorityURL_ and _Identifier_
pair in WMS capabilities documents (version 1.3.0 only).

Configuration for an external authority looks like this:

[source,xml]
----
<DatasetMetadata>
  <ExternalMetadataAuthority name="myorg">http://www.myauthority.org/metadataregistry/</ExternalMetadataAuthority>
...
</DatasetMetadata>
----

Now follows the list of the actual dataset metadata. You can add as many
as you need:

[source,xml]
----
<DatasetMetadata>
  <MetadataUrlTemplate>...</MetadataUrlTemplate>
  ...
  <Dataset>
  ...
  </Dataset>
  <Dataset>
  ...
  </Dataset>
  ...
</DatasetMetadata>
----

For each dataset, you can configure the metadata as outlined in the
following table:

[width="100%",cols="19%,9%,10%,62%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|Name |1 |String/QName |the layer/feature type name you refer to

|Title |0..n |String |can be multilingual by using the _lang_
attribute

|Abstract |0..n |String |can be multilingual by using the _lang_
attribute

|MetadataSetId |0..1 |String |is used to generate _MetadataURL_ s, see
above

|ExternalMetadataSetId |0..n |String |is used to generate
_AuthorityURL_ s and _Identifier_ s for WMS, see above. Refer to an
authority using the _authority_ attribute.
|===

==== Extended capabilities

Extended capabilities are generic metadata sections below the
_OperationsMetadata_ element in the _GetCapabilities_ response. They
are not defined by the OGC service specifications, but by additional
guidance documents, such as the INSPIRE Network Service TGs. deegree
treats this section as a generic XML element and includes it in the
output. If your service supports multiple protocol versions (e.g. a WFS
that supports 1.1.0 and 2.0.0), you may include multiple
_ExtendedCapabilities_ elements in the metadata configuration and use
attribute _protocolVersions_ to indicate the version that you want to
define the extended capabilities for.

=== Service controller

The controller configuration is used to configure various global aspects
that affect all services.

Since it's a global configuration file for all services, it's called
_main.xml_, and located in the _services_ directory. All of the
options are optional, and you can also omit the file completely.

An empty example file looks like follows:

[source,xml]
----
<?xml version='1.0'?>
<deegreeServiceController xmlns='http://www.deegree.org/services/controller' configVersion='3.4.0'>
</deegreeServiceController>
----

The following table lists all available configuration options. When
specifiying them, their order must be respected.

[width="100%",cols="30%,14%,10%,46%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|ReportedUrls |0..1 |Complex |Hardcode reported URLs in service
responses

|PreventClassloaderLeaks |0..1 |Boolean |TODO

|RequestLogging |0..1 |Complex |TODO

|ValidateResponses |0..1 |Boolean |TODO

|RequestTimeoutMilliseconds |0..n |Complex |Maximum request execution
time
|===

The following sections describe the available options in detail.

==== Reported URLs

Some web service responses contain URLs that refer back to the service,
for example in capabilities documents (responses to GetCapabilities
requests). By default, deegree derives these URLs from the incoming
request, so you don't have to think about this, even when your server
has multiple network interfaces or hostnames. However, sometimes it is
required to override these URLs, for example when using deegree behind a
proxy or load balancer.

TIP: If you don't have a proxy setup that requires it, don't configure the
reported URLs. In standard setups, the default behaviour works best.

To override the reported URLs, put a fragment like the following into
the _main.xml_:

[source,xml]
----
<ReportedUrls>
  <Services>http://www.mygeoportal.com/ows</Services>
  <Resources>http://www.mygeoportal.com/ows-resources</Resources>
</ReportedUrls>
----

For this example, deegree would report
_http://www.mygeoportal.com/ows_ as service endpoint URL in
capabilities responses, regardless of the real connection details of the
deegree server. If a specific service is contacted on the deegree
server, for example via a request to
_http://realnameofdeegreemachine:8080/deegree-webservices/services/inspire-wfs-ad_,
deegree would report _http://www.mygeoportal.com/ows/inspire-wfs-ad_.

The URL configured by _Resources_ relates to the reported URL of the
_resources_ servlet, which allows to access parts of the active
deegree workspace via HTTP. Currently, this is only used in WFS
DescribeFeatureType responses that access GML application schema
directories.

The URLs changed by this configuration option are overwritten by the URL
specified by the X-Forwarded-Host, X-Forwarded-Port and
X-Forwarded-Proto header values. For example via a request to
_http://realnameofdeegreemachine:8080/deegree-webservices/services/inspire-wfs-ad_
and the specified header values

----
* X-Forwarded-Host = www.mysecondgeoportal.com
* X-Forwarded-Port = 8088
* X-Forwarded-Proto = https
----

deegree would report
_https://www.mysecondgeoportal.com:8088/deegree-webservices/services/inspire-wfs-ad_.
The URL path is kept as in the request URL. Host, port and protocol are
replaced by the values from the header. If X-Forwarded-Port or
X-Forwarded-Proto are missing the values are taken from the request URL,
deegree would report
_http://www.mysecondgeoportal.com/deegree-webservices/services/inspire-wfs-ad_.
This behaviour is usefull when the deegree webservice can be requested
via different URLs.

==== Request timeouts

By default, the execution time of a request to a web service is not
constrained. It depends on the complexity of the request and the
configuration -- it's well possible to create a WMS configuration and a
GetMap request that will require hours of processing time. Generally, it
is the responsibility of the configuration creator to ensure that
service requests will return in a reasonable time (e.g. by applying
scale limitations in the layer configuration).

Nevertheless, it is sometimes desirable to enforce an execution time
limit. This can be achieved by using the RequestTimeoutMilliseconds
option:

[source,xml]
----
...
  <RequestTimeoutMilliseconds serviceId="wms1" request="GetMap">1000</RequestTimeoutMilliseconds>
  <RequestTimeoutMilliseconds serviceId="wms2" request="GetMap">2500</RequestTimeoutMilliseconds>
...
----

This example enforces the following time-out behaviour:

* GetMap requests to WMS instance wms1 will be interrupted after an
execution time of 1000 milliseconds
* GetMap requests to WMS instance wms2 will be interrupted after an
execution time of 2500 milliseconds

Besides the time-out value in milliseconds, the following sub-options
are supported by RequestTimeoutMilliseconds:

[width="100%",cols="19%,18%,13%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Option |Cardinality |Value |Description
|@serviceId |1 |String |Resource identifier of the service
|@request |1 |String |Service request
|===

NOTE: A time-out value can be configured for any service type and request.
However, a correct termination of requests requires that the relevant
Java code is actually interruptible. So far, this has only been verified
for GetMap requests to WMS based on feature layers.
