== Java modules and libraries

deegree webservices is a Java web application and based on code written
in the Java programming language. As a user, you usually don't need to
care about this, unless you want to extend the default functionality
available in a deegree webservices setup. This chapter provides some
basic knowledge of JAR (Java archive) files, the Java classpath and
describes how deegree webservices finds JARs. Additionally, it provides
precise instructions for adding JARs so your deegree webservices
instance can connect to Oracle Spatial and Microsoft SQL Server
databases.

NOTE: The terms JAR, module and library are used interchangeably in this
chapter.

=== Java code and the classpath

Java code is usually packaged in JAR files. If you want to extend
deegree's codebase, you will have to add one or more JAR files to the
so-called classpathfootnote:[The term classpath describes the set of
files or directories which are used to find the available Java code
(JARs and class files).]. Basically, there are two different types of
classpaths that determine which JAR files are available to deegree
webservices:

* The web application classpath
* The workspace classpath

The full classpath used by deegree webservices consists of the web
application classpath and the workspace classpath. If conflicting files
exist on both classpaths, the file on the workspace classpath takes
precedence.

TIP: If you're not familiar with classpath concepts and don't have any
special requirements, simply add your JAR files to the workspace
classpath and ignore the web application classpath.

==== Web application classpath

As deegree webservices is a Java web application, standard paths apply:

* Directory _WEB-INF/lib_ of the deegree web application (for JARs)
* Directory _WEB-INF/classes_ of the deegree web application (for Java
class files)
* Global directories for all web applications running in the container
(depends on the actual web container)

When you add files to the web application claspath, you have to restart
the web application or the web application container to make the new
code available to deegree webservices.

NOTE: All Java libraries shipped with deegree webservices are located in the
_WEB-INF/lib_ directory of the deegree webservices webapp. If you
downloaded the ZIP version, this directory is located in
_webapps/ROOT/WEB-INF/lib_.

==== Workspace classpath

When deegree webservices initializes the workspace, it scans directory
_modules/_ of the active deegree workspace for files ending with
_.jar_ and adds them to the classpath. This can be very handy, as it
allows to create self-contained workspaces (no fiddling with other
directories required) and also has the benefit the you can reload the
deegree workspace only after adding your libraries (instead of
restarting the deegree webapp or the whole web application container).

NOTE: In addition to workspace directory _modules/_, directory _classes/_
can be used to add individual Java classes (and other files) to the
classpath. This is usually not required.

WARNING: Since deegree 3.4 jdbc drivers are not longer loaded from workspace
classpath. Instead deegree follows the commonly used method to only use
jdbc drivers which are available either by the system (shared or server
libraries) or by the application (WEB-INF/lib).

=== Checking available JARs

In order to see which JARs are available to your deegree webservices
instance/workspace, use the "module info" link in the general section of
the service console:

.Displaying available JARs using the service console
image::module_info.png[Displaying available JARs using the service console,scaledwidth=50.0%]

The list of JARs section displays the JARs found on the web application
classpath, while the lower section displays the JARs found on the
workspace classpath.

=== Adding database modules

By default, deegree webservices includes everything that is needed for
connecting to PostgreSQL/PostGIS and Derby databases. If you want to
connect to an Oracle Spatial or Microsoft SQL Server instance, you need
to add additional Java libraries manually, as the required JDBC
libraries are not included in the deegree webservices download (for
license reasons).

==== Adding Oracle support

The following deegree resources support Oracle Spatial databases:

* SimpleSQLFeatureStore
* SQLFeatureStore
* ISOMetadataStore

In order to enable Oracle connectivity for these resources, you need to
add two JAR files (see <<anchor-adding-jars>>):

* A compatible Oracle JDBC driver (e.g.
_ojdbc8.jar_)footnote:[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index-091264.html
(registration required)]
* Module
deegree-sqldialect-oraclefootnote:[https://repo.deegree.org/content/repositories/public/org/deegree/deegree-sqldialect-oracle/${project.version}/deegree-sqldialect-oracle-${project.version}.jar]

==== Adding Oracle GeoRaster support

The _OracleGeoraster_ coverage store supports GeoRaster Objects stored
in Oracle databases.

In order to enable Oracle connectivity for these resources, you need to
add the following JAR files (see <<anchor-adding-jars>>):

* A compatible Oracle JDBC-driverfootnote:[http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/jdbc/index-091264.html
(registration required)]
** ojdbc8.jar
* The Oracle Spatial and GeoRaster libraries and their dependencies
** sdoapi.jar
** sdogr.jar
** sdotype.jar
** sdoutl.jar
** xdb6.jar
** xmlparserv2_sans_jaxp_services.jar
* Module
deegree-coveragestore-oracle-georasterfootnote:[https://repo.deegree.org/content/repositories/public/org/deegree/deegree-coveragestore-oracle-georaster/${project.version}/deegree-coveragestore-oracle-georaster-${project.version}.jar]

NOTE: The Oracle Spatial and GeoRaster libraries can be found, without version
number in filename, inside the Oracle Database installation directory.
The _sdo*_ files can be found at _ORACLE_HOME/md/jlib_, xdb6.jar at
_ORACLE_HOME/rdbms/jlib_ and xmlparserv2_sans_jaxp_services or
xmlparserv2 at _ORACLE_HOME/xdk/lib_.

NOTE: The _xmlparserv2_sans_jaxp_services_ is the recommended library, as it
does not contain _META-INF/services/_ entries. But if this library is
not available the _xmlparserv2_ can be used instead. (In rare
conditions this could set the oracle library as default XML parser,
which could lead to unexpected behavior).

==== Adding Microsoft SQL server support

The following deegree resources support Microsoft SQL Server:

* SimpleSQLFeatureStore
* SQLFeatureStore
* ISOMetadataStore

In order to enable Microsoft SQL Server connectivity for these
resources, you need to add two JAR files (see <<anchor-adding-jars>>):

* A compatible Microsoft JDBC driver (e.g.
_sqljdbc4.jar_)footnote:[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/aa937724.aspx]
* Module
deegree-sqldialect-mssqlfootnote:[https://repo.deegree.org/content/repositories/public/org/deegree/deegree-sqldialect-mssql/${project.version}/deegree-sqldialect-mssql-${project.version}.jar]
