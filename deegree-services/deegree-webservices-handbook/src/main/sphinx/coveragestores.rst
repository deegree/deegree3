Coverage stores are resources that provide access to raster data. The two most common use cases for coverage stores in a deegree workspace are:

* Accessing via WCS
* Providing of data for raster layers

You can access this configuration level by clicking on the **coverage stores** link in the administration console. The configuration files are located in the **datasources/coverage/** subdirectory of the active deegree workspace directory.
