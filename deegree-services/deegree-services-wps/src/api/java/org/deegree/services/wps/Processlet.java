/**
 * Implementations of this interface are (usually GIS-related) processes that can be registered in the deegree WPS, so
 * they can be accessed over the web by the means of the OpenGIS Web Processing Service protocol.
 * <p>
 * <h4>Processes, Processlets and the WPS</h4>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A {@link Processlet} may offer calculations as simple as subtracting one set of spatially referenced numbers from
 * another (e.g., determining the difference in influenza cases between two different seasons), or as complicated as a
 * global climate change model.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The deegree WPS is a feature-complete, efficient and scalable container for processlets (Java classes implementing
 * the {@link Processlet} interface). The WPS handles the protocol as defined by the OGC Web Processing Service
 * specification while a {@link Processlet} implements the computational logic of a concrete process.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A deegree WPS process consists of a Java class implementing the {@link Processlet} interface and an XML configuration
 * file that has to validate against <a href="https://schemas.deegree.org/core/3.5/wps/process_definition.xsd">
 * https://schemas.deegree.org/core/3.5/wps/process_definition.xsd</a>). Besides the definition of metadata, the XML
 * configuration file references the implementation class with its fully qualified class name.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <h4>Accessing the input and output parameters of the Processlet</h4>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE</b>: The {@link Processlet} code must never create the input and output parameter objects manually -- they
 * are instantiated by the WPS automatically and given as parameters to the
 * {@link #process(ProcessletInputs, ProcessletOutputs, ProcessletExecutionInfo)} method. A {@link Processlet} just
 * needs to retrieve the parameter objects that it expects and read/set their values.
 * <p>
 * It is essential to know the relevant interfaces for dealing with input and output data. For input data, please refer
 * to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.deegree.services.wps.input.BoundingBoxInput}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.deegree.services.wps.input.ComplexInput}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.deegree.services.wps.input.LiteralInput}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * For output data, please refer to:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link org.deegree.services.wps.output.BoundingBoxOutput}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.deegree.services.wps.output.ComplexOutput}</li>
 * <li>{@link org.deegree.services.wps.output.LiteralOutput}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <h4>Notes on thread-safety</h4>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * As the {@link Processlet} lifecycle concept is analogous to that of Java <code>Servlet</code>s, the implementer is
 * responsible of ensuring thread-safety: The container only creates one instance of a specific {@link Processlet},
 * regardless of the number of simultaneous executions. This implies that the implementation of the
 * {@link #process(ProcessletInputs, ProcessletOutputs, ProcessletExecutionInfo)} method <b>must not</b> change any
 * static or member variables to perform the computation. If you're unsure about this, please check out documentation on
 * the thread-safe implementation of <code>Servlet</code>s.
 * </p>
 * <p>

 * href="https://wiki.deegree.org/deegreeWiki/HowToCreateWPSProcesses">deegree wiki<a>.
