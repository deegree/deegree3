      <documentation>-- Definition --&#13;
An identification of the fixed location of property by means of a structured composition of geographic names and identifiers.&#13;
&#13;
-- Description --&#13;
NOTE 1 The spatial object, referenced by the address, is defined as the "addressable object". The addressable object is not within the application schema, but it is possible to represent the address' reference to a cadastral parcel or a building through associations. It should, however, be noted that in different countries and regions, different traditions and/or regulations determine which object types should be regarded as addressable objects. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 In most situations the addressable objects are current, real world objects. However, addresses may also reference objects which are planned, under construction or even historical.&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 3 Apart from the identification of the addressable objects (like e.g. buildings), addresses are very often used by a large number of other applications to identify object types e.g. statistics of the citizens living in the building, for taxation of the business entities that occupy the building, and the utility installations. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 4 For different purposes, the identification of an address can be represented in different ways (see example 3). &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 1 A property can e.g., be a plot of land, building, part of building, way of access or other construction,&#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 2 In the Netherlands the primary addressable objects are buildings and dwellings which may include parts of buildings, mooring places or places for the permanent placement of trailers (mobile homes), in the UK it is the lowest level of unit for the delivery of services, in the Czech Republic it is buildings and entrance doors. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 3 Addresses can be represented differently. In a human readable form an address in Spain and an address in Denmark could be represented like this: "Calle Mayor, 13, Cortijo del Marqués, 41037 Écija, Sevilla, España" or "Wildersgade 60A, st. th, 1408 Copenhagen K., Denmark".</documentation>

External object identifier of the address.&#13;
&#13;
-- Description --&#13;
NOTE 1 An external object identifier is a unique object identifier published by the responsible body, which may be used by external applications to reference the spatial object. The identifier is an identifier of the spatial object, not an identifier of the addressable object. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 The primary purpose of this identifier is to enable links between various sources and the address components.&#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE An address spatial object from Denmark could carry this identifier: &#13;
Namespace: DK_ADR&#13;
Local identifier: 0A3F507B2AB032B8E0440003BA298018&#13;

External, thematic identifier of the address spatial object, which enables interoperability with existing legacy systems or applications. &#13;
&#13;
-- Description --&#13;
NOTE 1 Compared with the proper identifier of the address, the alternative identifier is not necessarily persistent in the lifetime of the address spatial object. Likewise it is usually not globally unique and in general does not include information on the version of the address spatial object. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 Often alternative address identifiers are composed by a set of codes that, e.g., identify the region and the municipality, the thoroughfare name and the address number. These alternative identifiers will not remain persistent e.g. in the case of the merging of two municipalities. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE In Denmark many legacy systems (e.g. in the Statistics Denmark or the Central Business Register) uses as address identification the three digit municipality code plus the four character street name code plus the address number.</documentation>

The main (parent) address with which this (sub) address is tightly connected.&#13;
&#13;
-- Description --&#13;
NOTE 1 The relationship between a set of subaddresses and the main address most often means that the sub addresses use the same locator and address components (for example , thoroughfare name, address area, post code) as the parent address. For each sub address additional address locators are then included for identification, like e.g. flat number, floor identifier, door number. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 In some countries several levels of parent-, sub- and sub-sub-addresses exist. In other countries the concept of parent addresses does not exist; all addresses are thus of the same level. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 1 In a Spanish city the address "Calle Gran Vía 8" is a parent address where the locator "8" represents the building. In the building, the sub address "Calle Gran Via 8, door 3" represents a sub-address, while the more detailed sub-sub address "Calle Gran Via 8, door 3, staircase A, floor 5, dwelling 1" represents the address of a specific dwelling. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 2 In Denmark the legislation on addresses define two types of addresses: the parent "access level" and the sub "unit level". In the city of Copenhagen "Wildersgade 60A" is a parent access address that represents a specific entrance to a building. Inside the entrance, subaddresses using floor and door designators identifies the individual dwellings like e.g. "Wildersgade 60A, 1st floor, left door". &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 3 In The Netherlands only one level of addresses exists. </documentation>

    <annotation>
      <documentation>-- Definition --&#13;
Human readable designator or name that allows a user or application to reference and distinguish the address from neighbour addresses, within the scope of a thoroughfare name, address area name, administrative unit name or postal designator, in which the address is situated.&#13;
&#13;
-- Description --&#13;
NOTE 1 The most common locators are designators like an address number, building number or flat identifier as well as the name of the property, complex or building.&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 The locator identifier(s) are most often only unambiguous and meaningful within the scope of the adjacent thoroughfare name, address area name or post code. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 3 The locator could be composed of one or more designators e.g., address number, address number suffix, building number or name, floor number, flat or room identifier. In addition to these common locator types, also narrative or descriptive locators are possible.&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 4 The locators of an address could be composed as a hierarchy, where one level of locators identifies the real property or building while another level of locators identifies the flats or dwellings inside the property. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 1 In a Spanish city a "site-level" locator could identify a building on the thoroughfare name "Calle Gran Vía using the address number "8". If the building has four entrance doors, the door number "3" could be the "access-level" locator. The 3rd door could, via two staircases "A" and "B", give access to a number of floors, identified by a number "1" to "5" on which a number of dwellings are situated, also identified by numbers "1" to "3"; The "unit level" locator will thus composed of staircase-, floor- and dwelling identification e.g. "staircase A, floor 5, dwelling 1". In total, the three parent-child levels of locators uniquely identify the dwelling. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 2 In Copenhagen an "access level" locator could identify a specific entrance door in a building on the thoroughfare name "Wildersgade" using the address number "60A" (In Denmark the optional suffix is a part of the address number). The entrance door gives access to a number of floors, e.g, "st", "1", "2", "3", on which two dwellings are situated "tv" and "th". The "unit level" locator will thus be composed by a floor- and a door identifier: "2. th." (2nd floor, door to the right). In total, the two parent-child levels of locators uniquely identify the dwelling. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 3 In The Netherlands only one level of locators exists. The individual apartment within a large complex, a dwelling, a part of other kinds of buildings (for example an office), a mooring place or a place for the permanent placing of trailers are addressable objects which must have an address. This address is the only level of the locator. This locator could be composed by three attributes the house number, plus optionally an additional house letter, plus optionally an additional housenumber suffix.&#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 4 Sometimes the building name is an alternative identifier to the address number e.g. the house located in "Calle Santiago, 15, Elizondo-Baztán, Navarra, Spain" is also identified by the building name "Urtekoetxea"</documentation>

&#13;
NOTE 2 As locator name it is also possible to use a description that allows a user to identify the property in question. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 3 The locator name could be an alternative addition to the locator designator (e.g. the address number) or it could be an independent identifier. &#13;
&#13;

The address component that defines the scope within which the address locator is assigned according to rules ensuring unambiguousness. &#13;
&#13;
-- Description --&#13;
NOTE 1 For the assignment of unambiguous locators (e.g. address numbers) different rules exists in different countries and regions. According to the most common rule, an address number should be unique within the scope of the thoroughfare name. In other areas the address number is unique inside an address area name (e.g. the name of the village) or postal designator (e.g. the post code). In some areas even a combination of rules are applied: e.g. addresses with two locators, each of them referencing to a separate address component. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 Locators that has the level of unit (like e.g. floor identifier and door or unit identifiers) are most often assigned so that they are unambiguous within the more narrow scope of the property or building; for these locators the association should therefore not be populated. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 1 In a typical European address dataset, parts of the addresses have locators which are unambiguous within the scope of the road name (thoroughfare name) while others are unambiguous within the name ogf the village or district (address area name). &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 2 In Lithuania and Estonia a concept of "corner addresses" exists. Corner addresses have two address numbers (designators) each of them referring to a thoroughfare name (primary and secondary street name). E.g. in Vilnius the address designated "A. Stulginskio gatve 4 / A. Smetonos gatve 7" is situated on the corner of the two streets. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 3 In the Czech Republic in some cities an address has two locator designators: A building number which referres to the address area (district, cz: "cast obce") and a address number that referres to the thoroughfare name. As an example in Praha for address designated "Na Pankráci 1690/125, Nusle" the designator "1690" is a building number unique within the address area (cz cast obce) "Nusle", while the "125" is an address number that has the thoroughfare name as its scope.</documentation>

Identifier or geographic name of a specific geographic area, location, or other spatial object which defines the scope of an address.&#13;
&#13;
-- Description --&#13;
NOTE 1 Four different subclasses of address components are defined: &#13;
o    Administrative unit name, which may include name of country, name of municipality, name of district&#13;
o    Address area name like e.g. name of village or settlement &#13;
o    Thoroughfare name, most often road name  &#13;
o    Postal descriptor &#13;
In order to construct an address, these subclasses are often structured hierarchically.&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 It is the combination of the address locator and the address components, which makes a specific address spatial object readable and unambiguous for the human user. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE The combination of the locator "13" and the address components "Calle Mayor" (thoroughfare name), "Cortijo del Marqués" (address area name), "41037" (postal descriptor), "Écija", "Sevilla" and "España" (administrative unit names) makes this specific address spatial object readable and unambiguous.</documentation>

External object identifier of the address component.&#13;
&#13;
-- Description --&#13;
NOTE 1 An external object identifier is a unique object identifier published by the responsible body, which may be used by external applications to reference the spatial object. The identifier is an identifier of the spatial object, not an identifier of the real-world phenomenon. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 The primary purpose of this identifier is to enable links between various sources and the address components.&#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE An address component spatial object from Denmark could carry this identifier: &#13;
Namespace: DK_ADR&#13;
Local identifier: 0A3F507B2AB032B8E0440003BA298018&#13;
Version identifier: 12-02-2008T10:05:01+01:00</documentation>

              <documentation>-- Definition --&#13;
External, thematic identifier of the address component spatial object, which enables interoperability with existing legacy systems or applications. &#13;
&#13;
-- Description --&#13;
NOTE Compared with a proper identifier of the address component, the alternative identifier is not necessarily persistent in the lifetime of the component spatial object. Likewise it is usually not globally unique and in general does include information on the version of the spatial object. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 1 National or regional sector-specific identifiers (like e.g. a number- or letter code) for administrative units, address areas (localities, villages, sub-divisions) or thoroughfare names, which are used by a number of existing legacy systems. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 2 In Denmark the four character municipal "road name code" (0001-9899) is only unique within the present municipality, thus if two municipalities merge, it is necessary to assign new road name codes.</documentation>

Another address component within which the geographic feature represented by this address component is situated.&#13;
&#13;
-- Description --&#13;
NOTE 1 The association enables the application schema to express that the subtypes of address components in the dataset form a hierarchy e.g. like: thoroughfare name within municipality within region within country &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 The representation of the hierarchy facilitates queries e.g. for a specific thoroughfare name within a given municipality or postcode. It is also necessary where the application schema is used to create or update, for example , a gazetteer which is based on the hierarchical structure of the address components. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 3 The multiplicity of the association allows it to express that a thoroughfare name is situated in a certain municipality and in a certain postcode. It is also possible to express, for example, that some thoroughfare names cross borders between municipalities and thus is situated within more than one municipality.&#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 1 In Spain many spatial objects of the thoroughfare name "Calle Santiago" exist. The association can express that one of the spatial objects is situated within in the municipality of Albacete. From the same example the municipality name "Albacete" is situated within the administrative name (region) of "Castilla La Mancha".&#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 2 In Denmark, several address area names entitled "Strandby" exists. In order to identify a specific spatial object it is necessary to know that the relevant spatial object is situated e.g. in the municipality of "Frederikshavn".</documentation>

      <documentation>-- Definition --&#13;
An address component which represents the name of a geographic area or locality that groups a number of addressable objects for addressing purposes, without being an administrative unit.&#13;
&#13;
-- Description --&#13;
NOTE 1 In some countries and regions an address area is a true subdivision of an administrative unit (most often a municipality), so that every address area is fully inside the municipality and so that every part of the municipality is within an address area. In other countries, the concept of address area names is less strict and based on local tradition or specific needs. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 In some situations an address area name is not required to obtain unambiguousness; instead the purpose is to make the complete address more informative and descriptive, adding a well known place name (e.g. of a village or community) to the address. This is particularly useful if the municipality or post code covers a large area. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 1 In Sweden a "Kommundel" (en: Municipal sub division) is a type of address area names that ensures that street names are unique within the sub division. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 2 In Spain an "Entidad de población" (en: population entity) has the same function. It is the general address area which depending on its characteristics can be classified as "Entidad Singular" (en: singular entity) or "Entidad Colectiva" (en: collective entity). Moreover, according to the population distribution, these areas can contain one or several "Núcleo de población" (en: population core) and/or "Población diseminada" (en: scattered population).&#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 3 In Denmark "Supplerende bynavn" (en: Supplementary town name) is sometimes compulsory to ensure uniqueness of street names within the post code, sometimes it is just useful extra information, that makes the address more informative.</documentation>

-- Description --&#13;
NOTE 1 This is a definition which is consistent with that adopted by the UPU&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 A subdivision of a thoroughfare name into semantic parts could improve parsing (e.g. of abbreviated or misspelled names) and for sorting of address data for example for postal delivery purposes. It could also improve the creation of alphabetically sorted street gazetteers. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 3 The data type requires that each part of the subdivided thoroughfare name is qualified with information on the semantics e.g. if it is a thoroughfare type (e.g., Rua, Place, Calle, Street), a prefix (e.g., da, de la, del), a qualifier (e.g., Unterer, Little) or if it is the core of the name, which would normally be used for sorting or indexing. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 4 In some countries or regions and for some thoroughfare names it is not feasible or it does not add value to subdivide the thoroughfare name into parts.&#13;

A number or a sequence of characters that uniquely identifies the locator within the relevant scope(s). The full identification of the locator could include one or more locator designators.&#13;
&#13;
-- Description --&#13;
NOTE 1 Locator designators are often assigned according to a set of commonly known rules which enables a user or application to "parse" the information: Address numbers are most often assigned in ascending order with odd and even numbers on each side of the thoroughfare. In a building, the floor identifier represents the level according to the traditions within the area, e.g., 1, 2, 3. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 Several types of locator designators exist, such as: Address number, address number suffix, building identifier, building name. A locator could be composed by an ordered set of these. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE In Paris, France a locator could be composed by two locator designators: address number "18" and address number suffix: "BIS".</documentation>

  <element name="PostalDescriptor" substitutionGroup="ad:AddressComponent" type="ad:PostalDescriptorType">
    <annotation>
      <documentation>-- Definition --&#13;
An address component which represents the identification of a subdivision of addresses and postal delivery points in a country, region or city for postal purposes. &#13;
&#13;
-- Description --&#13;
NOTE 1 The postal descriptor is specified by means of a post code and/or names of the associated post office, town or area.&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 In some countries post codes are seen as a proper geographic subdivision of the country, in other countries the post code is regarded only as an attribute that characterizes a (usually small) number of adjacent postal delivery points and addresses. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 3 The postal descriptors are created and developed on the basis of postal requirements (e.g. efficient sorting, logistics, transport and distribution). Consequently, there is not often a tight relationship between the postal areas and administrative units in the same area.&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 4 The structure schema and formats of national postal descriptor systems are different. Sometimes (for example in the UK) the post code itself is the only information required for a valid address; in other situations both the post code and the associated name of post office or town is required. Sometimes there is a simple relationship between the code and the name; in other situations a set of postcodes are associated with a single post office or town.&#13;
&#13;
NOTE 5 In some countries like e.g. The Republic of Ireland, no post code system currently exists, therefore the postal descriptor is only represented by the name of the post town. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 1 In the UK the post code "EC4M 7DR" is sufficient, as a postal descriptor, while the related town name "London" is informative, but not necessary in the postal address. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 2 In Sweden all postcodes starting with "80" is related to the postal name "Gävle". Therefore in the postal descriptor "802 74 Gävle", the postcode "802 74" bears all postal necessary information, while the town name "Gävle" is extra information. &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 3 In Denmark, outside the centre of Copenhagen, each postcode has a 1:1 relationship to one post name only: Postcode "6372" relates to the village "Bylderup-Bov". &#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE 4 In Germany the lowest level of the Postal descriptor (the 5 digit Postleitzahl) often does not fall within an administrative unit (e.g. municipality). The Postleitzahl is handled completely independent from the hierarchal systematic of the addresses. In addition, some "Postleitzahlen" represent not a delivery area, but institutions with a big amount of post.</documentation>

One or more names created and maintained for postal purposes to identify a subdivision of addresses and postal delivery points. &#13;
&#13;
-- Description --&#13;
NOTE 1 Often the post name (or names) is a supplementary identification of the post office to which the associated post code belongs. For example it may be the name of the town in which the office is situated. In other situations the post name could be an independent descriptor without any post code or it could be a postal subdivision connected to a parent postal descriptor (post code and post name). &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 In some countries like e.g. Spain and The Netherlands, no post names exit therefore the postal descriptor is only represented by the post code. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 3 Even though the post name is the same as the name of an administrative unit or an address area, the area covered are not necessarilythe same.</documentation>

A code created and maintained for postal purposes to identify a subdivision of addresses and postal delivery points. &#13;
&#13;
-- Description --&#13;
NOTE 1 The structure, schema and formats of post codes are different in different countries. Often the components of the post code are hierarchical, e.g. when the first character(s) identifies the region covered by the post code and the next characters define the subdivision. &#13;
&#13;
NOTE 2 In some countries, e.g., The Republic of Ireland, no post codes exists therefore the postal descriptor is only represented by the post name (e.g. town name).&#13;
&#13;
EXAMPLE In the UK postcodes starting with W covers the Western (W1) and Paddington (W2-14) districts of the London postal district. In Sweden all postcodes starting with "80" is related to the postal name "Gävle".</documentation>
