        <documentation>The GeoSciML Earth Material package contains classes representing a description of a naturally occurring substance in the Earth.  

Earth Material represents material composition or substance, and is thus independent of quantity or location. Ideally, Earth Materials are defined strictly based on physical properties, but because of standard geological usage, genetic interpretations may enter into the description as well.

            <documentation>An EarthMaterial composed of particles composed of EarthMaterials, possibly including other CompoundMaterials. 

This class is provided primarily as an extensibility point for related domain models that wish to import and build on GeoSciML, and wish to define material types that are compound but are not rock or rock-like material. For most users of GeoSciML "RockMaterial" shoudl be used. </documentation>

Composition as used here is loosely construed to include both chemical composition and petrograpic composition, thus multiple values may be applied to a single rock, e.g. metaluminous and alkalic, undersaturated and basic, etc. Terms would typically include broad chemical classifications such as silicate, carbonate, ferromagnesian, oxide.  However, this attribute may have different terminology for different kinds of rocks - for example sandstone petrographic classification terms (e.g. feldspathic) might be placed here.</documentation>

            <documentation>The FabricDescription class describes all types of fabrics associated with a CompoundMaterial (ie, tectonic, metamorphic, sedimentary, igneous fabrics or textures).  It denotes a pattern, defined by one or more CompoundMaterial constituents, that is present throughout a rock body when considered at some scale.  FabricDescription is defined based on the average configuration of many constituents.  Penetrative fabric denotes that these constituents are distributed throughout the rock volume at the scale of observation [Passchier and Trouw, 1998], and are repeated at distances that are small relative to the scale of the whole, such that they can be considered to pervade the whole uniformly (Turner and Weiss [1963] p. 21-24; Hobbs and others [1976], p. 73; Jackson [1997]; Passchier and Trouw [1998]). 

FabricDescription is distinguished from Particle Geometry based on the criteria that Particle Geometry is preserved if a CompoundMaterial is disaggregated, while FabricDescription is not defined if the material is disaggregated.

Note that volume magnetic susceptibility is dimensionless, being magnetization (magnetic dipole moment) in amperes per metre (SI) divided by the applied field, also in amperes per metre. However, many tables of magnetic susceptibility and some instruments give cgs values that rely on different definitions of the permeability of free space than SI values. The cgs value of susceptibility is multiplied by 4pi to give the SI susceptibility value. For example, the cgs volume magnetic susceptibility of water at 20?C is -7.19x10-7 which is -9.04x10-6 in SI.

            <documentation>ParticleGeometryDescription describes particles in a CompoundMaterial independent of their relationship to each other or orientation. It is distinguished from Fabric in that the ParticleGeometryDescription remains constant if the material is disaggregated into its constituent particles, whereas Fabric is lost if the material is disaggregated.  Properties include the particle size (grainsize), particle sorting (size distribution, eg: well sorted, poorly sorted, bimodal sorting), particle shape (surface rounding or crystal face development, eg: well rounded, euhedral, anhedral), and particle aspectRatio (eg: elongated, platy, bladed, compact, acicular).

            <documentation>The Constituent Part class describes how Earth Materials may be made up of other Earth Materials, including the proportion of the constituent part in the whole (eg: 20%, minor, dominant); the role that the constituent plays in the whole (eg: matrix, groundmass, framework, phenocryst, xenolith, vein). The particleType property that specifies type of particle (eg: grain, clast, crystal, fossil, oolite) has been moved to the ParticleGeometryDescription data type, associated with both ConstituentPart and CompoundMaterial (GeoSciMLv2, RC3, Uppsala, Sweden).

The distinction between "role" and "particleType" is subtle.  An operational test is that constituentType may be determined independent of relationship between particles in the aggregation, whereas role requires consideration of the relationship to other particles. A particle may be identified as clast, independent of its material composition, and independent of its relationship to other grains in a rock. The term 'floating clast' is a role, because it is dependent on the relationship 'not in contact with other clasts'. Consider Dunham's textural classification of carbonate rocks (wackestone, packstone, grainstone...) in the description of carbonate rocks. The description is predicated on identification of two kinds of intraclasts (grains) and matrix (carbonate mud), and then uses this distinction to establish relationships--mud supported vs. grain supported -- that define roles for the two types of constituents (framework, matrix...).

examples of type vs. role:
Particle type: clast. Role: framework, floating particle

particle type: crystal. Role: matrix, pseudomatrix (in case that matrix is interpreted as recrystallized material)

particle type: clast. Role: matrix (in case that matrix is interpreted as very-fine grained detrital fraction)

particle type: crystal. Role: cement (in case that material insterstitial to particles is crystalline material introduced during diagenesis)

particle type: crystal. Role: phenocryst (in igneous rock)

particle type: microlite Role: groundmass (in porphyrytic igneous rock)

particle type: crystal. Role: framework (in igneous rock)

particle type: pyroclast. role: framework (in tuff)

particle type: crystal Role: oikocryst

particle type: crystal Role: overgrowth

particle type: biogenic particle Role: floating particle

particle type: ooid Role: framework </documentation>
