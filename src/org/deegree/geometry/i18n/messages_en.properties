CURVE_CONTAINS_LINEAR_SEGMENT=Cannot determine control points for curve, contains a non-linear segment.
CURVE_CONTAINS_LINEAR_SEGMENTS=Cannot determine control points for curve, contains non-linear segments.
GML_INVALID_GEOMETRYID="{0}" is not a valid GML geometry id. A geometry id must not start with a digit and may not contain a separating colon (:).
RING_CONTAINS_LINEAR_SEGMENT=Cannot determine control points for ring, contains a non-linear segment.
RING_CONTAINS_LINEAR_SEGMENTS=Cannot determine control points for ring, contains non-linear segments.
SURFACE_IS_NON_PLANAR=Cannot determine control points of surface ring, surface is non-planar.
SURFACE_MORE_THAN_ONE_PATCH=Cannot determine control points for surface ring, surface has more than one patch.
SURFACE_NOT_EQUIVALENT_TO_POLYGON=Cannot convert surface to JTS polygon -- currently only simple polygons consisting of a single polygon patch can be converted.
CRS_GEOMETRY_HAS_NO_CRS=The coordinate system of the geometry to be transformed was not set.
