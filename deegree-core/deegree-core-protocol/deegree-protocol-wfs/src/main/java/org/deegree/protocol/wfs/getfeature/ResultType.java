 * Used for discriminating between the two <code>GetFeature</code> modes:

 * Since WFS spec 1.1.0, a WFS can respond to a query operation in one of two ways
 * (excluding an exception response). It may either generate a complete response document
 * containing resources that satisfy the operation or it may simply generate an empty
 * response container that indicates the count of the total number of resources that the
 * operation would return. Which of these two responses a WFS generates is determined by
 * the value of the optional resultType parameter.
