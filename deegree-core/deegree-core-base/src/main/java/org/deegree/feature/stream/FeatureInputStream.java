/**
 * Provides streaming access to {@link Feature} objects provide by a source.
 * <p>
 * The primary means of accessing the individual result features is to use the
 * {@link #iterator()} method and subsequently call it's {@link Iterator#next()} methods.
 * Depending on the implementation (e.g. when backed by an SQL result set), this enables
 * the processing of arbitrary large numbers of results without causing memory issues.
 * Also, it's essential to ensure that the {@link #close()} method is called afterwards,
 * or resource leaks may occur (e.g. open SQL result sets).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A safe use of a {@link FeatureInputStream} looks like this:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   ...
 *   FeatureInputStream fis = null;
 *   try {
 *       // retrieve the FeatureInputStream
 *       fis = ...
 *       for ( Feature f : fis ) {
 *           // do something with the feature
 *           // ...
 *       }
 *   } finally {
 *       // make sure that the FeatureResultSet always gets closed
 *       if ( fis != null ) {
 *           rs.close();
 *       }
 *   }
 *   ...
 * </pre>
 *
 * </p>
