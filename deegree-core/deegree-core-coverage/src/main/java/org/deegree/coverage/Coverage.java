/**
 * 
 * A Coverage, as defined by the OGC and ISO/TC 211, is a function describing the distribution of some set of properties
 * over a spatial-temporal region. It is a mathematical function from a spatial-temporal set (called the domain of a
 * function) to some value set (called the range of the function).
 * 
 * <p>
 * Coverage are not always gridded data. Although a Coverage might be based on a grid (e.g. a Raster) or a rectified
 * grid, it might also be based on a collection of curves, triangles or other geometries. Common examples of coverages
 * include remotely sensed images and aerial photographs, as well as soil, rock type, temperature and elevation
 * distributions. <cite>From GML-Geography Mark-Up Language, by Ron Lake et. all (Wiley & sons Ltd., published 2004)
 * page 234/235.</cite>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The above idea is captured by this Interface, to get a sampled part of the coverage the getAsRaster method can be
 * used.
