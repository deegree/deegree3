/**
 * A <code>CompositeGeometry</code> is a geometric complex with underlying core geometries
 * that are (as a whole) isomorphic to a geometry primitive. E.g., a composite curve is a
 * collection of curves whose geometry interface could be satisfied by a single curve
 * (albeit a much more complex one). Composites are intended for use as attribute values
 * in datasets in which the underlying geometry has been decomposed, usually to expose its
 * topological nature.
