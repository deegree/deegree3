/**
 * A {@link TriangulatedSurface} that uses the Delaunay algorithm or a similar algorithm
 * complemented with consideration of breaklines, stoplines, and maximum length of
 * triangle sides. These networks satisfy the Delaunay's criterion away from the
 * modifications: For each triangle in the network, the circle passing through its
 * vertices does not contain, in its interior, the vertex of any other triangle.
 * <p>
 * One can notice that the useful information provided for the Tin element is solely the
 * trianglePatches, since the stopLines and breakLines (along with maxLength and
 * ControlPoints) are only needed to obtain the triangulation. However, GML allows to
 * specify both, so the interface provides access to them.
