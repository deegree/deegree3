/**
 * {@link CurveSegment} that uses either polynomial or rational interpolation.

 * Description from the GML 3.1.1 schema:
 * <p>
 * A B-Spline is a piecewise parametric polynomial or rational curve described in terms of
 * control points and basis functions. Knots are breakpoints on the curve that connect its
 * pieces. They are given as a non-decreasing sequence of real numbers. If the weights in
 * the knots are equal then it is a polynomial spline. The degree is the algebraic degree
 * of the basis functions.
 * </p>
