CRS_CONFIG_NOT_START_STAX_ERROR=Error while parsing the {0} from Element with localname: {1}, because: the reader is not at a start element
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_DATUM_WITHOUT_ELLIPSOID=CRS_ID: {0}, A Datum is given: {1}, but no ellipsoid has been created, this cannot be.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_ELLIPSOID_WITHOUT_SEMIMAJOR=CRS_ID: {0}, An ellipsoid was defined, without defining the semi-major-axis (=a), this cannot be!.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_INVALID_ID=(Line: {0}). {1} is expected after {2}. Found following value instead: {3}
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_MISSING_EXPECTED_CHAR=(Line: {0}). The following character was expected: {1}.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_NOT_ADDING_CRS=Not adding CRS with id: {0}, because: {1}.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_NO_PROJ_PARAM=No proj parameter was found, the PROJ4CRSProvider doesn''t know how to map the crs with id\: {0}. 
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_UNKNOWN_DATUM=CRS_ID: {0}, The given proj4 datum:{1} could not be created, because no mapping was found.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_UNKNOWN_ELLIPSOID=The given proj4 ellipsoid: {0} could not be created, because no mapping was found.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_UNKNOWN_PM=CRS_ID: {0}, The given proj4 prime-meridian {1} could not be created, because no mapping was found.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_UNKNOWN_PROJECTION=The given proj4 projection: {0} is not supported by the deegree-crs-library, currently transverseMercator, lambertConformalConic, lambertAzimuthalEqualArea and stereographicAzimuthal are supported.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_UNKNOWN_UNIT=CRS_ID:{0}, the given unit:{1}, could not be mapped to a valid unit.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_WGS84_PARAMS=CRS_ID:{0}, ToWGS84 can either have three (shift parameters) or seven (full bursa wolf parameters, you supplied: {1}.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJECTEDCRS_FALSE_CRSREF=The ProjectedCRS with id: {0}, references a coordinatesystem with id: {1}, which does not denote a geographic crs.
