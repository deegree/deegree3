Coordinate Transformations allow the chaining of operations to map coordinates of one coordinate systems onto a
coordinate valid in another coordinate system. They can thus be viewed as a glue which binds all operations necessary to
define a 'global' transformation.
<p>The base class of all of these transformations is the Transformation, which supplies abstract methods for the
actual transformation of coordinates between two different crs. The most important one is the abstract doTransformation
method. A concrete implementation of the CRSTransformation will handle the incoming coordinates as is appropriate for the
transformation it defines.</p>
