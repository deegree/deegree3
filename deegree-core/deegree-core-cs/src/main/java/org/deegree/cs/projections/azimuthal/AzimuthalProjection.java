/**
 * The <code>AzimuthalProjection</code> class functions as a super class to all azimuthal
 * projections.
 * <p>
 * (From wikipedia) Azimuthal projections have the property that directions from a central
 * point are preserved (and hence, great circles through the central point are represented
 * by straight lines on the map). Usually these projections also have radial symmetry in
 * the scales and hence in the distortions: map distances from the central point are
 * computed by a function r(d) of the true distance d, independent of the angle;
 * correspondingly, circles with the central point as center are mapped into circles which
 * have as center the central point on the map.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The mapping of radial lines can be visualized by imagining a plane tangent to the
 * Earth, with the central point as tangent point.
 * </p>
