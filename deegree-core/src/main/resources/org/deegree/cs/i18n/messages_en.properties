CRS_CONFIG_NO_ELEMENT=No {0} definition found for id: {1}
CRS_CONFIG_NO_ID=No id's found for given element with localname: {0}, this may not be.
CRS_CONFIG_NO_PROVIDER_DEFS_FOUND=Could not load the property file: {0} which is used to define the CRSProviders: defaulting to the Deegree-CRS-Provider.
CRS_CONFIG_NO_PROVIDER_FOUND=Property 'CRS_PROVIDER' was not set in file: {0} defaulting to the Deegree-CRS-Provider.
CRS_CONFIG_NO_RESULT_FOR_ID=Definition for id: {0} could not be read from deegree CRS definition document, because: {1}
CRS_CONFIG_PARSE_ERROR=Error while parsing the {0} from Element with localname: {1}, because: {2}
CRS_CONFIG_PARSE_STAX_ERROR=Error while parsing the {0} at location: {1}, because: {2}
CRS_STAX_CONFIG_PARSE_EXCEPTION=Error while parsing the {0} because: {1}
CRS_CONFIG_NOT_START_STAX_ERROR=Error while parsing the {0} from Element with localname: {1}, because: the reader is not at a start element
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_DATUM_WITHOUT_ELLIPSOID=CRS_ID: {0}, A Datum is given: {1}, but no ellipsoid has been created, this cannot be.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_ELLIPSOID_WITHOUT_SEMIMAJOR=CRS_ID: {0}, An ellipsoid was defined, without defining the semi-major-axis (=a), this cannot be!.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_INVALID_ID=(Line: {0}). {1} is expected after {2}. Found following value instead: {3}
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_MISSING_EXPECTED_CHAR=(Line: {0}). The following character was expected: {1}.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_NOT_ADDING_CRS=Not adding CRS with id: {0}, because: {1}.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_NO_PROJ_PARAM=No proj parameter was found, the PROJ4CRSProvider doesn't know how to map the crs with id: {0}. 
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_UNKNOWN_DATUM=CRS_ID: {0}, The given proj4 datum:{1} could not be created, because no mapping was found.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_UNKNOWN_ELLIPSOID=The given proj4 ellipsoid: {0} could not be created, because no mapping was found.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_UNKNOWN_PM=CRS_ID: {0}, The given proj4 prime-meridian {1} could not be created, because no mapping was found.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_UNKNOWN_PROJECTION=The given proj4 projection: {0} is not supported by the deegree-crs-library, currently transverseMercator, lambertConformalConic, lambertAzimuthalEqualArea and stereographicAzimuthal are supported.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_UNKNOWN_UNIT=CRS_ID:{0}, the given unit:{1}, could not be mapped to a valid unit.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJ4_WGS84_PARAMS=CRS_ID:{0}, ToWGS84 can either have three (shift parameters) or seven (full bursa wolf parameters, you supplied: {1}.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJECTEDCRS_FALSE_CRSREF=The ProjectedCRS with id: {0}, references a coordinatesystem with id: {1}, which does denote a geographic crs.
CRS_CONFIG_COMPOUND_FALSE_CRSREF=The compoundCRS with id: {0}, references a coordinatesystem with id: {1}, which does denote a valid crs.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJECTEDCRS_FALSE_PROJREF=The ProjectedCRS with id: {0}, references a Projection with name: {1}, which could not be instantiated as a projection.
CRS_CONFIG_PROJECTEDCRS_INVALID_PROJECTION=The projection: {0}, is currently not supported, following projections are supported {1} are currently supported.
CRS_CONFIG_REFERENCE_ID_IS_EMPTY=The {0} element from the crs with id: {1}, may neither be null nor empty.
CRS_CONFIG_USEDDATUM_IS_NULL=Couldn't find a datum with id: {0} for the crs with id: {1}, incorrect configuration.
CRS_COORDINATESYSTEMS_WRONG_AXIS_DIM=A {0} coordinate system can only have {1} axis.
CRS_INVALID_NULL_ARRAY=The given array may not be null or empty.
CRS_INVALID_NULL_PARAMETER=The given parameter may not be null.
CRS_PARAMETER_NOT_NULL=In {0}, the {1} parameter may not be null.
CRS_TRANSFORM_END_GT_LENGTH=The end position exceeds the length of the source coordinates array.
CRS_TRANSFORM_LAST_LT_START=The last coordinate may not be less then the startPosition of the source coordinates.
CRS_TRANSFORM_SRC_WRONG_DIM=The number of points to transform can not be mapped to the dimension of the coordinatesystem correctly.
CRS_TRANSFORM_START_GT_LENGTH=The start position of the sourceCoordinates is greater than the length of the source coordinates array.
CRS_TRANSFORM_WRONG_CRS_DIM=The dimension of the {0} CoordinateSystem can not be smaller then 2 or larger then 3, hence no transform can be applied.
