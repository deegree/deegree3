## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you encounter a security vulnerability in deegree please take care to report the issue in a responsible fashion:

-  Keep exploit details out of the issue report (send to TMC privately â€“ just like you would do for sensitive sample data) and mark the issue as a vulnerability!
-  Be prepared to work with Technical Management Committee (TMC) members on a solution!
-  Keep in mind TMC members are volunteers and an extensive fix may require fundraising and other kinds of contributions!
